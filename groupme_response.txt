If we had all 8 of us, we would need at least 152 to break the per bun record. So, so doable 
On an easy night I do a whole tray by myself 
I have never been more confident in this group of men to achieve this record 
Let’s do it 
19 rolls each, that’s a lot of carbs 
I don’t care when or where. We are getting this done 
Easy… 
Fellas we are BREAKING THIS RECORD. I couldn’t think of a more able group to go to war with  https://v.groupme.com/27071733/2021-10-11T03:47:42Z/64b918e2.576x1024r.mp4

I butchered that joke 
Actually I should have said what about your main in all star brawl
That looks 🔥🔥🔥
But what about your main in smash?
My main gonna be Patrick star 😩
Basically another smash character I’ve never heard of to me. Time to jump on the all star brawl bandwagon. 
The real winner of the crispy chicken sandwich competition 😋
I own one, but they are hard to get into. You’ve gotta commit to the whole series, and I think there are at least 4 games. Really cool series I’ve heard
Sora is cool especially since they had to get Disney to say yes to it. But Iv never played any Kingdom Hearts games so doesn’t me an a whole lot personally
It really is devastating. He’d better be on the cover of the next game
Although I’m surprised they got Sora, because isn’t he technically Disney?
My man Waluigi will never get the respect he deserves 
Master Chief was a long shot 
But I’ll take Sora over another FE character 
I was hoping for Master Chief 
Is anyone excited about Sora?

Also, I’ve gone back and forth a couple times on the poll from this morning FYI. I still am unsure of where I stand according to the wording.

As long as that level is sea level
Nothing else is on the same level as this

It really is fantastic. It’s hard to stay away. 
Iv probably had more Taco Bell in the last year than I have had in a long time 
I guess I missed that whole thing
Suffice it to say: I have had beef with Taco Bell for a year or two. And not Taco Bell beef. 
I’m confused
Maybe it’s some sort of underlying message… 
Dude Kori is the problem. She’s the one always pushing me to go. These are confusing times!!!! 
Does Kori know? 
I know it dude, I know it. You think I felt good about it? I felt dirty and abused. 
But yes they are fantastic. Better than I remembered

Christopher Nolan
Dark Knight trilogy is closer in genre to inception than it is to Marvel (at least in my head)
Okay. That’s all I have to say on the matter. 
The dark knight trilogy are the only super hero movies I will ever watch on purpose. And he doesn’t even have super powers, he’s just a rich mofo. 
Also, according to today John’s got a v sooo
My issues might just be based on super hero movies in general. The huge fight scenes that last 45 min at the end of every movie? Kill me. So boring. Billions of Faceless space alien bad guys? Stupid. TIME TRAVEL!? Biggest cop out ever. 
The things John was willing to do for the V 
Could you even see out the fogged windows?
Oh trust me dude I know. First and only time I watched this was at the stupid drive in, stuck in a car with Andie. I was ready for it to end before it started

Imagine If taika directed the LOTR tv show

imo Marvel has much better fight entrance scenes, like endgame, Thor in infinity war, etc. then Marvel just has the best humor in a superhero movie
As the resident ADHD kid, iv never been able to sit through a whole LOTR movie. Thor Ragnarok alone could keep me entertained forever 
That’s how I felt about endgame. Infinity war lived up to the hype imo 
Infinity war had soooo much hype. It definitely delivered, but a lot of people were expecting the best movie of our lifetimes
Although I’ll disagree with Logan. Infinity war was a masterpiece
Two Towers extended edition alone makes this an easy choice
But LOTR…. 😩

And just to get it out of the way. Zach: “but what about the sandwiches?”
They were 4-6 inches and I would get 2 or 3 of them I think 
Fellas I need your help. Idk what reminded me, but the other day I remembered a fast food item I used to eat all the time in high school but I don’t remember where it’s from or a lot about it. I remember it was a flat bread thing. I’m pretty sure it was a chipotle chicken flatbread. Pretty sure there were other flavors as well. I’m leaning Taco Bell but I can’t remember for the life of me.

I’m on a family account
We have Apple Music 
We would be down if we can get one other person to split
Yeah, I figured most of us mooch off family. We get Disney + from my parents lol
Can confirm you can keep your old account. I would join but I run my family’s account
It looks like you can. We start the family plan and then invite current accounts to join.
Great question 
Would we have to give up our current account? Kori would not be down if she had to start over lol
We are looking to start Spotify premium, it supports 6 accounts for the family plan ($15/month), anyone want to split it?

I like to judge new items on whether they enhance the menu or not. Meaning, when I go to ____, is this item a viable option every time I go. I can see myself ordering the McD’s sandwich again as a normal meal, thus it enhances the menu. While very good, The KFC sandwich didn’t pass that test for me. It’s their classic chicken, which is awesome, in a bun with pickles and mayo. It was great, but I would never order that over their normal chicken buckets. They do have a spicy option, which I’ll try next time. But ultimately, it didn’t get the job done. 
Fellas. Here’s my report on the KFC Chicken Sandwich

Has everyone at least tried the new Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich?
@Ben Pagel If you’re going to put such blasphemy in this chat, I’m going to need you to use your inside voice.
I’m gonna say something and I know many of you won’t like it but after trying the shamrock shake for the first time, it’s really not very good
The only thing I got from this is that Epstein didn’t kill himself...
But Crispy Chicken no doubt
That was a very short poll

And I’ll go even more on a limb and say that lately the best pizza I’ve had is on Alfredo Sauce, with chicken and bacon and spinach 
Alright fine I’ll say it: I’d take Domino’s above any other pizza chain in the other categories
I didn’t show it, but total overall is pushing 8000 messages
I think those are when Logan changes the icon or when a poll closes etc. @Jon Michael Ossola really needs to step up his game
Especially since GroupMe has contributed more than @Jon Michael Ossola 
Those are some interesting statistics 
Just a little statistics for ya

Also recently had the Popeyes chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint 
Jeez, don’t make me break the sabbath
I want to try it with the spicy buffalo next time, or their new hot sauce
It was good! I'll be honest, it doesn't match up with CFA, not that I expected it to, but it was really good. I'll for sure get it again and go spicy next time. Its the 2nd best crispy chicken sandwich lol
Mcd crispy chicken sandwich is super good
I respect the Smash picks boys. Severely underrated

I feel like we need a categorical tier list. One for pizza, burgers, chicken etc. 
I could put it above Arby’s I guess

I put Arby's in there twice just for @John Hammond

Yeah it was cool. I didn’t recognize a lot of them, and a lot of the ones I did he didn’t. But overall a pretty sound list. 
No I’m with you there. I just liked the fact that he ranked so many different places
CFA is S-Tier for me too. But just listen to his description. Sounded like he some CFA corporate officer had a gun to his head. Think for yourself people. Seek out the flaws, because they are there! 
Hahaha I knew you’d hate that part
Just another brainwashed CFA lover smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Denny’s definitely isn’t S but I do think it’s underrated
Denny’s as S-Tier is definitely something

Still halfway there
So close to greatness. 
Can you show us the statistics 📈 
I guess Jackson I’m saying I agree with you in a sense. A lot of people like CFA over McDonald’s, but it’s a different type of place so of course it’s supposed to be better in theory. I think we both agree McDonalds is better dollar for dollar. I don’t know if I can quite make the leap and say it’s better overall but I definitely respect the opinion
But CFA is tricky because it’s more like a Culvers type place price wise. 
And Jackson, for me I like to compare it to it’s economic group. I put McD with Wendy’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, etc (and I rank it above all of those)
Frozen 2 >>> Frozen 
But I do agree that chick fil a got over hyped by the white Twitter girls of the world. It’s annoying that people seem to think that it can’t be touched but just because the hype is annoying doesn’t mean that it doesn’t deserve the hype. It’s like frozen. Great movie. It got overhyped but that’s not the movie’s fault
What’s something comparable to CFA? McD’s? 
I know this is a cop out but honesty I don’t think you can rank them. Too different, it’s apples and oranges 
You will all stand accountable for your sins
I used to think CFA was over rated, but I’ve changed my mind over the last year ish. I think it is rated. But I agree that a lot of people have unjustified hard-ons for it
John actually just hates a lot of notifications from this group chat
And I respect that 
But I am a respecter of all opinions 
It’s been defiled 
This chat was once a temple
Would you guys stop, I’m trying to stare at GME all day
Literal dog s***
Don’t you dare 
Absolute crap
Don’t 
McDoubles?
Here I think only Zach knows this about me
When is the last time CFA did anything to get you that excited. When is the last time CFA got you guys hard. I think the recent spicy sandwich is their first change in years. CFA is just there. It’s elite. But it’s just there quietly doing absolutely nothing. Is there any feeling that rivals that first McD’s fry? Or that first bite into your McDouble? Break free of your shackles. 
Think about the Shammies gentleman. The fries the drink the mcbitchin the Buffalo sauce. Think about how exciting the menu always is. They’re always trying something new and rarely miss (we don’t talk about the McRib) 
We are all brainwashed. Can’t you see it? It isn’t cool to criticize or dislike CFA because it’s society’s baby girl. But when you step back and take a look, you see the truth. 
Why do you insist on inciting violence Jackson?
Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich >>>>>>>>
Haven’t been impressed with ifunny recently, where do y’all get memes?
I’ve known for awhile now and I’m sick of hiding. I’ll take it to the grave 
McDonald’s >>>> CFA
But I’m going to say something.
I’ve been known in this chat to compare CFA to the Taylor Swift of country music, meaning it’s untouchable and not even comparable to other fast food restaurants. It’s on its own level
Yeah I really like them. The flavor is elite. I think the Wendy’s texture is better, but McD’s really did something here
There solid
Who here has tried the McDonald’s spicy nuggs?
I read his AMA today and he says to hold.
I love me some Mark Cuban

Wow
The real question is, how many am I buying tomorrow
Paper hands Dave 
How many shares do you have?
He literally said today “I sold all my meme stock” 😂😂
He literally joined only for the memes, bought high, and sold low when he got tired of losing money. 🧻🙌🏻
Exactly, he’s a simp 
Dave Portnoy sold today, so you lost practically the entire Barstool army 😂 said he lost 700k
I’ll sell at $10000 or $0. I’m either going on a yacht or food stamps 
If you chums are still holding it’s time to sell. Shammies are back on February 15th. ITS SHAMMY SEASON

You know what I’ve begun to appreciate lately? The fact that we have so many subgroups in our group. Like we got: careers, computer nerds, sports, video games, stocks, living in the same building, living in the same state etc. I love it.

Here is what’s terrifying. You can enhance your amiibos with spirits. I have created a beefy sonic, if you can imagine how things are going. I’m getting 2 stocked consistently. 
He hasn’t figured out how to really get out of it yet. He will become a spinny boy and if he misses, he just runs off the edge 😂 I love him for his dedication 
😍😍😍
He’s ready for you Jackson 
We are working on it
He spins himself off the edge quite often
Some people just want to watch the world burn
Currently training my son, Spinny Boy. You guys are done for
My american history teacher just said “nucular” energy and I don’t know if I can do this
Even tho you won’t see this post until your next birthday, happy birthday John 😘😂
HBD 
To the second oldest friend in our group. Love you brother happy bday 💦💦💦❤️❤️❤️
I know it’s not until tomorrow but happy birthday @John Hammond
We just getting back too
It was good man! The traveling part with babies low key sucks, but it was fun
Alright man. How was the trip?
I can’t tonight we just landed in UT
I’m trying to hang with you gamers lol
Among us tonight?? In like a hour?? 
And now I can’t get it to start 😭
Oh yeah mine did that
I’ve spent the last hour updating my Gpu drivers and I’ve never been so impatient in my life
But I’m not speaking for Zach and Logan 
I can’t play until Monday when I get back 
I have downloaded it so I could play tonight 🤷‍♂️
LOL
Also, turns out my other laptop have 32GB of RAM and a gtx 1070 ti so I can actually run it 😅🤦‍♂️
Well... on a whim, I bought the 3 pack...
Squadrons is a blast guys. Can’t wait to squad up
She thicc 
I haven’t played in many weeks. I wonder how she’s doing
Oh yeah. She’s beefy
Jeez 90 GB for battlefront 2
In like 3 hours
Done. Let’s play bois
Does that work with credit card companies too @Logan Camilletti ??
Battlefront 2 is must-own
👏🏻dont👏🏻ask👏🏻permission👏🏻ask👏🏻for 👏🏻forgiveness👏🏻
Laura just asked about buying this dress that's like $20 and I was like "as long as I can buy squadrons." lol
Battlefront 2 is gold. Fallen order is worth 25 bucks easy
Easiest purchase you can ever make dude
This is dangerous
This might help make a choice to get it  
Created new poll 'I own Star Wars squadrons or plan on buying it this week.': https://s.groupme.com/2q7vA6
I’m back on Monday lol but I’m down then!!
Ayeeeeeee
We gonna get a squad goin on squadrons?
Bro 😂😂😂
I tried out the battlefield games for the first time. Pretty litttt
Star Wars empire at war is a hoot
I’ve paid for one month to try it out 
Anyone else use EA Play? 
@Ben Pagel  you should build your own
Shad from left field 😂
😂😂😂
Sounds awesome 
Lol I saw you playing that last night 
I just bought Hades and I’m addicted. 
6.5/10 over all for fallen order
Cool visuals and good use of the force. 
$25 for each individually basically
It’s a cool Star Wars game. If you like the fighting style, you’ll love it more. I played through once and most likely will never play again
I guess that sounds about right 
That seems like a lot. How much is fallen order? 
All three is $50 on steam
Fallen Order is a question for Logan. I played it for a bit but never fell in love with it enough to buy my own
Battlefront 2 is still awesome 
That and squadrons you can get easy for 25 or so maybe 30 max 
Battlefront 2 is practically free rn 
Well I was thinking about it and now I’m eyeing a new gaming pc as well 🤦‍♂️
Ben just buy it and upgrade later
I was looking at that versus Jedi fallen order as well as battlefront 2. But if everyone gets squadrons I’ll get it
Idk if my computer can run it
I really want to
If one of you guys get it lmk and we can squad up
I think I’ve said this to Logan before but you pilots would absolutely love it. And it’s half price right now 
How is it?
I own that SOB
Oh dude 
Anyone thinking of getting Star Wars squadrons?
The final product
Oh dude. I’ll buy a sonic one. 
Laura decided to paint it lol. I’ll take requests if anyone wants their own amiibos
That is so cool
So I got one of those amiibo things for a Kirby and it got really frustrating to get beat with my own moves.
Can’t wait 
Lmaooooo
How do we feel about the Madden 21 pro bowl
Also me (minus the 4K HDR 120 fps bit)
You still coming though right John?
GameStop is sold out on a lot of those controllers. I’m devastated
Nvm I’ll just post it again 
We gonna smash?
How can I like a pic more than once 
My gif was pertaining to Friendsgiving
PC + Switch + PS5The holy trinity
I have no dog in the fight btw 
Also who’s pumped for friendsgiving 
Boom roasted
I never said they were bad. Just great for 8 year olds
I don’t ever want to see console slander in this chat again
Zach
Going down with his ship
You gotta respect the mans dedication

Dude LeBron’s post 😂😂😂😂
But I agree, there’s a few free market policies that will usually make me vote conservative but that’s about it. 
Ban
I’ll be honest I’m less of a fan of a lot of trump policies so I’m okay with it
I’m moving to Canada
nOt mY pReDiDenT 
So, president Biden???
Seems pretty anti democratic to me
Hate to say it but Trump has been the one trying to stop vote counting
Unlikely though
It could end up 50 50 with Kamala as the tie breaker 🤮
Senate majority isn’t a guarantee though 
Biden abolishing our democracy with a republican senate? Yeah don’t think that’s gonna happen
That’s me so yup
Comedy show?
...
Same, we’re busy
I can’t I’m sorry
Us too. Sorry
We can’t tonight unfortunately 
Well since the world is going to end how about some among us tonight? 
My mom says if Biden gets elected we won’t ever have an election again as he will abolish our democracy. 
I haven’t checked since Wednesday. I forget it’s still going on. It won’t be for a long time 
That’s awesome haha

What are y’all thots?  
Anyone else watching this while praying
Psh 8-3 lead gg’s boys. GG EZ.

Very punny Logan...
I just started playing today. Pretty fun. Funnier than I thought 
Lol, company of heroes, Starcraft, you name it

8:15-8:30
Like this message if you’re gonna get on at 8
Cool Ben
At the gym rn

Are you laughing or suggesting the game
Ben and I are gaming. Anyone wanna hop on lol
I’m free to get on whenever
Brooo 😂
That’s awesome 😂
They just cancelled work for tomorrow too 😂😅🙏
Also rip to everyone’s notifications. We are very sorry
Jackson.. I’ve liked every comment on this group chat, aside from a few @Ben Pagel memes
Zach all your comment liking confuses me. You liked my comment saying 2 or 3!
Also I have class until 5:30
And I’m supp every time and don’t even think about taking it
I’ll play but I won’t like it
If we get 1 more we have a squad
Yeah I’ll plan on 2
Lmao
Let me download it
I’m so down
Please
Let’s LOL
Dude
Rocket league does, but I’m not sure what else
Depends on the game
Is there cross compatibility for switch and pc?
Gotcha
I already owned it on steam for like a year at that point
Civ 6 was free on epic
It wasn’t on sale on steam at the time 😂
Civ 5 is better tbh
Can we play together?
On the switch
Yup
Anybody got civ 6?
I’ll slide into those dms
Dude I love the grown up snow day vibes 
Oh this is For Kaylee by the way haha
Also I know this is a weird ask, but for any of you that have her number would you guys mind wishing her a happy birthday? She’s having a tough time. Mostly self inflicted, for sure, but we are still looking out for her lol
I can play at like 2 or 3 most likely?
Or anything on the switch
These are the options. And minecraft
Company of hero’s?
Thank you for your service btw 🇺🇸
What are we playin
I’m down to game this afternoon for suuure
Dang Ben. Be careful out there bro 
The Air Force does snow days now?
Are you kidding me
Welcome to the south
Yeah same. It is 12 F here though
It is cold as frik
There is 0 snow on the ground here, that’s crazy you got a ton 
How much snow did you get??
Anyone get a snow day today? I’m off work and gonna play some games
I can’t tonight unfortunately 
Among us?
I frickin ironed that shirt man. Didn’t even show up in the picture
*You’re how embarrassing
All your missing is a belt clip for your phone 
Zach this is not slander at all. It is actually with all due respect. But I think of this group you definitely give off the most dad vibes. And it isn’t close. 
I’ll send a code to the discord when I’m ready 
*to whom it applies
I’ll be sure to share that with her right away
Share with your wives as well
https://discord.gg/sFGJ4F
Unless you guys already have one! If so invite me!
Sure! I’ll make one
Yeah! That works! Should we play through discord? 
Kori and I are in. I can only play until 9 or so. So maybe we start at 7?
I’m in
Among us tonight?
Invest in Johnson & Johnson. Shout out from trump! 
You have to win to see it @Jackson Esplin 
How did we not notice this 🤣🤣🤣
Still thinking about this
But at least Pepsi is still a sponsor! Sorry Teri 
It’s whatever but I’ll miss the name 
RIP Pepsi center boys. 
We just got off unfortunately 
You guys still playing?
Kori and I are going to play some among us. Anyone else want in?
2 Buffalo chicken sliders, 2 orders of fries, and a shake. 5 dollars. 
What did you get? 
I’m going to say something controversial:Arby’s 2-5pm dollar menu deal is the best in all fast food. The damage is done. 
Dude 🤣🤣🤣
Whenever you guys want to play put it in the chat. I love that game
Literally wasn’t imposter once
Also could’ve been “When you finally become crewmate after 30+ games of being imposter” for Ailyn. 
Jackson and I on the last game last night
Djirrq 
Is there a voice chat?
OXIXRQ
I’m down
Shoot, Katie and I are going to a friends house tonight ☹️
I’ll create a lobby at 8. How did you guys play last time? Discord?
8 works. Who else??
Like 8? 
Kori and I are planning on playing!
Big among us game tonight? 
I just like playing Sonic for my boy @John Hammond 💦💦
Lmao Sonic betrayed me yesterday. I got Katie up to 200% on her last stock and couldn’t get it done. He doesn’t have that finishing power 😂 
There’s a sonic game in there, I know how much you love sonic Jackson 
If you’re seriously interested we’ll just give it to you. We’d love to keep it in the family
What games?
$50 for the ps2 and stuff
Yo how much lol
We’re selling our ps2s and this nerf controller is giving me hardcore nastalgia
I just got home unfortunately 😭
What is everyone up to tonight?
Or company of heroes???
Among us tonight? 
Another divine beast among other things 
What kind of DLC?
Another 20 hours bare minimum in my opinion
Dude DLC is so incredible
There’s DLC?
DLC is totalllly worth it
I don’t even think I’m 100 hours into botw... but I also don’t have any of the DLC
You’re right. I will probably wait for Christmas now
I really might get it. But tbh, you got a lot of time to put into the games you already got hahaYou can’t quit Until you get 100 hours in botw
Nostalgia sells. Can’t wait to play that sunshine again
Oh yeah and smash
3D all stars is tempting me right now. Do you not have smash?
See if you can borrow Mario Odessa. That’s like 10 hours play time max. No need to purchase
Botw, Minecraft, Mario kart 
What do you already have?

Too expensive. I am saving up for Steve on smash
Company of heroes 2 is $1 on steam rn
For Harambe 
Or out...
Just in time for your anniversary. I’m sure you can whip something up
We will be praying for you brother! 
I’ll be lucky if I can make anything happen tonight 😂😂
Enjoy the night 😉
Tastes like sleep deprivation at the moment, and thank you lieutenant 
Welcome home airman 
How does freedom taste?
Back on American soil boys 🇺🇸 
Kori and I love playing among us. We should get a big game together. We can’t tonight tho
I like you this is the message I receive first thing in the morning. Really priorities my day. 
Anyone tryna play games at all today? Missing the bois ❤️
But specifically the engine. The part that’s busted is hydraulic￼
Lol Zach yes
Zach why you messaging during the sacrament? 
Wait, isn’t your job to fix jets
BuT mA fReE hEaLtHcArE 
And ya, the bag is extra. Freaking Europe haha
Ya so I got stuck in Qatar for an extra day. Now the jet broke down when we landed here, so we will be stuck in Glasgow till at least Tuesday. Honestly tho, this is a paid vacation. I also get a 120$ per diem. 
You have to pay for the bag??? 
Better than Qatar 🇶🇦 
Still stuck here haha
Yaaaaa
Ah. So I assume your not getting home last Friday then?
Glasgow
Scotland 
London?
Ok

It says I can’t add you. 
Friend code?

Add you on what @Jake Linford 
Dude we need to get a gazer Among Us game lol
Yo add me OG_LARRY
My computer is trash

Ill be on in like 30 mins
Mac here 🖐 
We all have PCs?
I’m in probably
So games tonight or nah?
Smash is life
Well, Laura is addicted.. to the mii creating page. Next step is to buy smash
I can this weekend for sure
Rocket or legends?
I’m on league rn
Rocket league?
Lol
Fortnite? 
But pc I’m good
Anything tbh. I don’t have switch online yet
So I don’t have smash yet
I’ll smash ;)
What are we playin?
Anyone tryna play tonight?
Oh and 256 gb SD card
It’s deal even without those useless games just for the controllers
I feel like I came across a great deal, two pro controllers, botw, Mario kart, fifa19, Skyrim, Minecraft for $425
Guess who just bought another switch even though he has a switch coming in the mail.

Boys. I will be home Friday night. After a weekend of passionate lovemaking and jet lag, I’m down for just about anything. 
I for sure can this weekend!!
Lmao
Bummer
No Zach, I am trying to redeem myself from playing terribly last time in star craft
Do you need me to make you a spreadsheet or something?
Sorry bro, maybe two weeks I’ll have a ton of time tho. I’ll hit you up
Anyone not busy and on a pc?
K
Nope
Logan is this your mission prez? 
To be honest I don’t mind targeted ads, I’d rather have the option to buy a Facebook app and not see ads at all, but that will never happen
Exactly why I hat FB. Targeted marketing
All of a sudden I am seeing ad after ad for switches
Who tf voted kfc over chipotle, it’s unfair to even put a bottom tier up against the top tier
I hardly ever comment on fb but when I do I have to make it count

Shad Karlson 2020
Shad putting Nathan to bed... 
Literally never played a game as sick as BOTW
That’s a solid pro
Your kids will be playing it just like you played the N64 growing up
And it’s far and beyond the best console for couples/families. It’s a blast when I can get Kori on and beat the snot out of her in Mario Kart
Looking forward to BOTW 2, another testament of Zelda. 
I’d like to testify to what my companion said. I know these things are true because I still play my switch after almost a year
I promise you will not only play the first two months. Especially with the new All-Stars release, you’ll be plenty busy with all your content. Not to mention, in my opinion, you’ll have the greatest game of our generation in Breath of the Wild. And there are so many other all-time exclusives 
Is that what you guys call sex
I can resolve a couple of your issues. The director has already confirmed that switch is only halfway through its life cycle. So we have it until at least 2023, barring anything unforeseen. We could get a pro version with upscaled 2k/4K res but the switch is here to stay for awhile 
I’ve unofficially chosen prime day to grab one from Amazon but I’ll let Laura know at the next companionship inventory
Just buy one. You make salary now brother. 
Things we are considering:Cons1. At least in the next two months I should be doing homework2. What if we play it only when we have people over (after the initial two months or so)3. What if a new Nintendo console comes out within the next two yearsPros1. I friggin want one really bad and I’m graduating so who cares if I get Cs
I regret not bringing my switch out here 
Zach this is going to sound financially irresponsible but it really is the must-own console. The possibilities are endless 
Showing Laura the Minecraft DLC definitely got us a step closer to getting a switch
Creative as frik
I’ve been needing some LOL
I can’t tonight but I am so down
I ended up crashing into the Empi- Hudson
Or LOL
Anyone wanna play some Starcraft tonight? It’s been too long

I would give anything to play among us with you all

Dude nice 
Lol I was looking for one forever and then found one in Oklahoma (since they’re sold out like everywhere) so I got one
Ben you have a switch???
That’s not saying much Ben
Cmon Zach, even I have one
I should probably buy a switch
We preordering this shiz?
It’s going to be a good time
But BOTW 2 is still coming later
No so Hyrule Warriors isn’t really anything like a typical Zelda title. It’s more focused on the combat. There probably won’t be an open world or crafting or such, rather you’ll get to collect, build, and upgrade weapons. In past Warriors games there were multiple playable characters, which is exactly what they’ll do here with the other heroes set in the pre ganon
We are still expecting a different game for that?
That’s not botw 2, right? 
RIGHT? I was waiting for you to wake up and see it 😂
Hell. Yes. Jackson.That looks amazing

I know, you’d love Lake Powell!
Dude I would be there in a heartbeat 
Bring your own in laws
I’ll bring my own boat
Zach just bring your own gas and a tent. 
I wish but unfortunately no since the money also goes towards gas for the houseboat and stuff. I think the food is a pretty small percentage of cost 
If I bring my own food could I come for free?
This is probably a long shot since it’s so short notice but if anyone is interested, my in laws and I are looking for people to go on our Lake Powell trip this week since a few people bailed on the trip. It’s Aug. 22-28 and the cost per person is $300 which helps with the cost of the house boat and food 
Always hard to pass up on that

That’s Bradley and who? Kinda looks like Jon Michael or Sam.
YOU MEAN SHE DOESNT KNOW
I respect all of your opinions and reservations, but I’m just saying: there is so much untapped, high tier, unique content there. I would encourage everyone to give it a taste
The fact that it’s algorithm is so good is another factor for me. It and Facebook/Instagram are literally engineered to be addictive. I also go and play 10 hours of Minecraft so I’m not judging those who do spend time on those sites, just not for me.
Once it’s no longer under China control I’m more likely to look at it

Alright I’ve gotta spread the good word to the anti-tik tokers in the chat. Some of the funniest, most creative content I’ve ever seen is on that site. There are some unbelievably talented and creative people out there. Their FYP page algorithm is perfect. I have seen one, maybe two of the 15 year old chicks throwing their ass back for all the creepy 40 year olds. It’s very easy to manipulate your algorithm to the content you’re looking for, and once you get there, it’s glorious. Seriously, keep an open mind and give it a shot
This is for all the John’s out there

So Laura and I bought the good place, hacksaw ridge, arrival, the Martian, and baby driver so you can expect to see those on the Plex soon. 
A lot of them are cheaper as a bundle. Like jumanji 2 was like $25 but both jumanjis together was $20. 
Chuck is the 🐐
I’m surprised how cheap some of those are

So I don’t know if it’s normal for Utah, but I sat in chipotle today for lunch and every girl that walked in had on only a sports bras and like yoga pants (and a mask obviously). What’s the deal with that? Is this just really Zion?
Good luck fam❤️

Mine from a while back
What does based mean?
Yeah it was definitely pretty weighted. I would like to find something similar that’s less biased, I haven’t really thought about most of those topics and I probably should
I have also taken that same quiz and do feel like it naturally pushes you left on more nuanced topics. I can say strongly disagree to abortion but when it words a question on race like “All people have their rights, but it is better for all of us that different sorts of people should keep to their own kind.” or “Our race has many superior qualities, compared with other races.” Those are completely loaded questions if you even slightly start to disagree. But I’m white so my opinion doesn’t matter
Don’t want to jeopardize that
We’re on good terms at the moment
I dare you to show that to your mom
Kick him out. Kick him out now
I might get disowned for this
It’s their sliders man
I also have never had their roast beef
So Arby’s is in my top 10 and I’ve never once had roast beef from there because I don’t like it either...
John: “my personal vendetta against roast beefThe boys: 
I think there are many factors like: person behind the grill, location, suppliers, cleanliness, quality of service, that can make or break an experience. Jack and the box has been on both sides for me, I’ve had great burgers, great experiences as well as horrible food, and terrible experience.
Gold
“My personal vendetta against roast beef”
Now I think everyone knows me by now that I am a bIt picky and very opinionated when it comes to fast food. Jack In The Box is no exception and the only reason it doesn’t get an F is for its curly fries and memories made there after church dances and what not. Now Jackson I hear what you are saying already. “Arby’s has great curly fries too so they shouldn’t get your F either” and to that I say good point I don’t have a rebuttal. Beside my personal vendetta against roast beef. And my argument is far more nuanced than this and I see many flaws in my words and thought processes but I’ll leave it at that
Created new poll 'Where does Jack in the Box fall in your fast food tier list': https://s.groupme.com/2ezjlP
I had Jack in the Box for the first time in a really long time today, and it got me thinking about where it falls in our group and that it often gets overlooked. Obviously all of our tiers are a little different, but I’m going to make a poll so you can share your thots:
Bens is left, Jackson’s is right. 
We’re missing one vote
But in reality he is...
Ben’s is darker and more pronounced than mine. And I’m not talking about his schlong

BYU’s first game of the season got cancelled because of the PAC-10 going all conference. So did Alabama’s. Now there are strong rumors of BYU vs. Alabama week 1 and I cannot wait for BYU to lose by 80 points 😂😂😂

Ya he clearly has white savior complex, it’s gross 
I heard very little. I think I heard “prison system” and something about the wall haha
He was always that guy who was super, super proud of being liberal in such a conservative community. He acted above everyone else as if he was the only one who was different. Kind of like someone’s sister. Though I think he is more legit left than she is. 
What were they arguing about? Could you hear?
As my mom would say, “being a good person and a liberal are mutually exclusive”

I love for carried away Jackson
Sorry. I got carried away
Is she black? He’s probably arguing with her saying that she is oppressed and just can’t see it, and that he will fight for her. 
Lol. Two fingers down on the table. It even got more heated after that
What a date
That looks like an intense conversation 
He was straight up ARGUING with this poor chick about something political 
Yup. Hair by keaton. I haven’t followed him in a long time too, but it was hilarious to see him
Basic Provo bro? I had to unfollow him, he’s such a soy boy

Also where’s this stepmom meme?
But to answer, “God looks on the heart”I think if you change as a person after you lose your memory then you’ll be judged on the person you are after the change 
That wasn’t even that bad
If laughing so hard at Zach’s stepmom meme from a couple months ago brings me down then so be it
Maybe for calling him ninner. Idk
We were all going to hell long before ninner hit his head

Alrighty everyone. I’m officially opening my BAMF to everyone in this chat. (Big Accumulation of Media and Film). It’s essentially Netflix, but I “own” all the movies and anyone I give access to can watch with internet connection.Some rules:1. This stays within the people of this chat. My computer isn’t super powerful yet, but it can handle probably upwards of 4-6 simultaneous streams (1080p).2. Please contribute. We have a goal of doing this legally, which means ripping blu rays. If you have a flash drive with movies though I won’t say no. I won’t force anyone to send me movies, but if we all bought a movie a month or something, we could essentially have all the new releases for 1/8 the cost.To participate:Download the PLEX app wherever you want it, make an account and send me your email so I can share it with you. The Plex app is available almost anywhere and through browsers.

I had a breakthrough moment today and I want you guys to sit back and think about this. And I want your thoughts on this. Tell me I’m wrong if you need to:I was eating my McDonald’s today and realized something huge. Nothing matches up with McDonalds. Not CFA, not TB, not Wendys, not anything. Think about that first bite into a McDouble/Hot Spicy/Fries/whatever. It’s a feeling you can’t get at any other place. Its different. It makes no sense, but it’s like CFA is the clear 🐐, but it still doesn’t even compare with McD’s. That doesn’t make sense, but yeah. McDonalds is top dog. Thots?

I used the gender inequality, to destroy the gender inequality
CFA fries with fry sauce are unstoppable... but without condiments they’re above average at best 
I’m actually surprised at the lack of CFA waffle fries. I thought those would win hands down
With 3 coming in at a very close #4
If no condiments then it has to be 5, 6, and 9 
3,6,4 from sonic, Arby’s, McDonald’s 
Respectively and respectfully 
*respectively 
But if I had to choose I would do 1, 6, 4 at Chick-fil-A, Arby’s and McDonald’s respectfully
I agree, it’s a little flawed. Like Waffle fries for example. CFA’s I couldn’t eat standalone, but the ones in that picture look 🔥🔥🔥
I think this entirely depends on the producer of fries. Like McDonald’s standard cut is incredible but other standard cuts are sub par
Pick your top 3 (standalone, no condiments)Mine are 6, 1, 4 in that order, with 5 coming in close at #4. But Steak fries would take the cake if I had ranch 💧💧💧

No it was Bradly. I knew him way more than I knew her sadly
No it’s Billy! Wasn’t it Billy? Maybe his real name was Bradley?
It’s going to be weird when all the Mormon kids add her as a friend all the sudden
Anyone else from our school or class doing cool stuff?
I’m not, she just popped up on my suggested friends list 
I don’t even know if I’m friends with her on FB
Yes it is 
Bruh it’s not about her, I have a man crush on most Avs players. My wife knows this 
Is that Girard?

The tweet is stupid, but this is one thing you have to look forward to...
You're an inspiration to us all
Congrats!!!
Send Kori our love as well!
Much love boys, appreciate it❤️
@Logan Camilletti Man you know I worked my butt off this week so I could still get my Stalk Market Sunday on. STONKS

Congrats my guy! Praying for the little GOAT

Dang! That’s awesome!!
Dang sign that kid up! The broncos need some linemen! Congrats Jackson! Love ya man! 👍🏽
Well gentlemen, Kori did it. 19 hours of labor, 4 hours pushing. 9lbs 4oz, 20.5 inches. Little dude is a chunky beast. He’s struggling to breath so he’s been in the NICU since he was born at 3am. He’s getting better. Mom is well!  https://v.groupme.com/27071733/2020-04-25T17:42:28Z/6fc504ea.568x320r90.mp4

Jackson, are you a dad yet?
Yeah, I’ve met a lot of people that hate it. I thought it was pretty great. 
Ive only watched legend of korra all the way through once and it was years ago. It doesn’t match up with the og but I don’t remember disliking it at all. Korra is a little annoying at times. 
What do you guys think about the legend of korra ??
I totally just finished the entire series 😂
Have you never seen it? Must-see TV
I might actually watch it now 😅

I made a video. I’m trying to send it
Results?
😂
I already know the results 
I’m so excited to hear the results 
Same cups. Same amount of ice. Kori is pouring so I don’t know which is which. I’ll be drinking water in between sips to cleanse the buds. Results coming soon. 
Like when Taco Bell charged us for water cups
Did you pay for food? Seems wrong
Good thing I keep a stash at home. I will never let monsters like her win
Ranch period. She wouldn’t give me any unless I paid. This is at the second window too. She was greedy af. 
Wait, are you serious? Like extra ranch?
Very rarely I bash on McDonalds, but every once in awhile there’s this b**** who is brand new tries to charge me for sauce. Come on, I didn’t start coming here yesterday.

Which part?
That’s gross... 
You’ve just accepted the possibility that your son could be a dodger player then?
It’s beautiful Jackson
Should have invested
Red arrow is Animal crossing release data
Honestly that name is great. Has a good ring to it! 
Kori came to me with the name. Who was I to decline naming my son after one of the greatest to ever do it? So for me it is, but for Kori I think she just really likes the name lol
As in Arenado?
We did end up deciding a name. Y’all gonna have a new nephew: Nolan Jason Esplin
That’s brilliant

Got it. 
Workin on it
Zach??
Real talk tho, we about to have a couple of dads up in this!Jackson, Shad, how the babies doing?
In my humble opinion I think they are better than McDonald’s shakes.
Really?? Imma have to try those
Arby's Andy's Mint Shakes are still around...
Well the Shammy’s are over now. They have been for weeks
Hot n spicy
You know what sandwich they don’t have in Idaho that breaks my heart every time I go
Even here in Vegas they don’t have it
You have to go to the one on S University past the temple. The bulldog one is basura 
I go for the hot n spicys 
Every time I tried, NO MOTHER DUCK SHAMMIES
Same
0
You know how many shammies I had this year?
Oh man we almost caught you slippin 
McDonalds??? 
...836
Alright. I’ll say it. 8, 3, don’t care
Where is Wendy’s 
Never heard of 2
369 for me as well
I’m still 3 6 9
The Utah version 
Anyone who picked 8 is my grandma 
anyone who picked 6 is an animal
None of you guys like Nutty bars????
3 5 9
Oh zebra cake me the f*** up
Right, Ailyn is going to the store. I included some on the list.. 
Imma run to Walmart real quick for some essentials...
273 for me
I f’n love those
444
Honestly, just 3. I never liked these kind of treats
Let’s hear them boys... 2,3,5 9 is super close though...
Man I haven’t had CD’s in forever... best wings ever
Gents we could guess the best fast food restaurant all night but I just have to say we had CD’s wings tonight and they are the real winner... 🍗 
So as a group, CFA and McD are probably a safe bet
1. McD2. CFA3. Arby’s4. Panda5. Wendys 6. Taco Bell (hoes ain’t loyal)7. BK8. Subway9. Popeyes (I’ve had it like twice in my life, one of those trying their sandwich.)
That’s pretty cool man. Being on Sportscenter is a freaking dream
I wasn’t in that picture
No haha
That isn’t you on the right, is it?
Yessir
I couldn’t see it very well
That’s gotta be you guys, right?? @Ben Pagel 
And that’s awesome Ben!
1. Chick2. McD3. Panda4. Taco Bell5. Wendy’s 6. Burger King7. Popeyes 8. Arby’s 9. Subway
Haha
Man, you couldn’t have written out the restaurant names lol
I’ll keep watching 
Idk, I just found out
In fact here’s my ranking:1. 32. 63. 94. 15. 86. 47. 28. 79. 5
Did I miss it??? It already happened??
Yessir
No way. Tonight?? I just started watching 😂
Air Force team handball made ESPN senior night on sports center 😤
Jon Michael with the TB love. That would have been my 4th choice 
No disrespect to Wendy’s. I love Wendy’s. 
3 6 7
318
3 6 9
Cmon Jackson McDonalds isn’t that much better than Wendy’s. Although I do agree it doesn’t make sense to put them both 
Because Wendy’s is very good
These are the places I be going 
(And they do 50% off in uniform Ben)
How can you guys justify putting Wendy’s on the board while leaving different foods like TB, Panda and others on the table? They’re both burger and fries, and McDonalds is 800000x better. 
Popeyes is honestly really good tho

Just bunk with @Jake Linford 
@Zach Preator We haven’t decided yet. I think we still want to try for June (financially it makes sense to do that rn so we don’t have to pay for housing and I’ll just move home) but we might have to report early which would make life a little more interesting... 
Just kidding that’s just for today 😂👍
@Ben Pagel  Are you guys still getting married in June? I know some couples that just got married civilly. You could totally do that
Aka: Nudes. Nice
Well when you’re not allowed to see your fiancée anymore, you make do
Who are you texting so much? It wasn’t me that’s for sure

Last night I watched a guy build an amusement park on Planet Coaster... I could stop watching it... it was literally like 7 hours... 
What is life
And I’m pretty sure I spent more time on my computer
Bruh, that 10 hours doesn’t even count the time on my laptop either...
Jake you gotta watch on your phone for it to count
I don’t know why I’m excited about that.
I was up until 4:30 this morning watching YouTube. Just on my lap top... 
I’d like to see any of y’all beat a 10 hour YouTube week
And r/buildapc 
Nice. 
Yup
What are you doing on safari? Researching computer parts?
But not this week
I like it when it’s like, great job, you were down 2% to 5 hours a day
That’s a full quarter of your day

They will but it’s going to be different than ever before. The CSAF and SECAF came and they wanted to graduate us this weekend but logistically that would’ve been a nightmare and so they pushed it back but they are cancelling/shortening classes rn and it’s wild
So they are probably not doing a cerimony then?
Neat

Air Force is considering the same rn 🙌
Just checked my email. We in bois
One is cherry
One might be cherry
DP has 23 flavors
Internet agrees. DP is not a cherry cola
Pibb straight from a can is one of my favorite things to drink at home.
So, since there is a cherry variation, no dr p is not a cherry cola
I thought so. I may have them mixed up. Even if they don’t advertise it, I think it’s still considered a Cherry cola
Does it??
Doesn’t Dr Pepper do that too?
Pibb extra advertises itself as a “spicy cherry soda”. 
I’m gonna say this, they are very different drinks. 
Honestly, I love that I get the two different drinks when I go to different places. Gives me variety, and makes me appreciate both of them. That's also why I have a mistress
Pibb tastes better from the fountain. DP tastes better from the can. Bottle is a toss up 
I’ve been thinking a lot about our Pibb vs DP discussion, and I realized that I’ve never actually had a choice between the two. The only time I’ve ever had Pibb is because a place doesn’t have DP, like Chipotle. And though every time I’ve had Pibb I’ve been blown away, I don’t know if I can say which one is better unless I try them both together. Has anyone actually done that?
Probably Shad 
Who the hell responded to Shads poll
Created new poll 'Will people respond to Shad’s polls?': https://s.groupme.com/NRO5KR
Would people respond if I did a few other polls? (Chipotle vs. Qdoba, etc.)
We should play wiffle￼ ball when we are all back together. 
My poor wallet 
Those where the days!! 
I don’t know if anyone else is getting this, but this is giving me major Summer 2014 vibes when we used to eat almost every day together for so many years ❤️❤️❤️ 
I also combined Taco Bell at McDonald’s because that’s what I would do in that situation 
I bet the change in your car could pay for all our meals
Technically it would be like $5.39 but i would just find change from my car to cover the extra
2 dollar burgers from McD, 4 piece nuggets dollar large fri with the app deals. If it’s over 5 bucks I find some charge under the seat of my car. 
Mini chicken quesadilla melt, Cinnabon delights, hot n spicy, sausage mcmuffin, and large McDonald’s coke
McBitchin and a Dr. Pepper
Spicy nugs and chicken sandwich 
Close second is 4 4 4
2 hot and spicy, fries and coke
Like it for lunch you were handed a $5 bill, what do you get
Favorite anything for under $5?
I can agree with that. I say we allow 5 guys/Smash and QDoba/Chipotle as fast casuals. These are our dream meals after all
My Taco Bell patronage is cyclical. Lately I’ve started going there a lot again and it’s honestly underrated af 
Fast casual
Ok so here’s the thing. I think smash/five guys are not fast food. I also don’t think that chipotle / doba are fast food. I think that you need to lump them all in the same category one way or another
Those Illuminati commercials were incredible
The Chipotle Chicken Griller and Nacho Fries were unrivaled. But they’re both gone because TB can suck a fat one smh. I hate their marketing ploys
Strong picks from the Shad man. Now we wait on JM and Ben
Cheesy potato griller is a great choice. 
At the same time, there’s no waiter which might classify it more towards fast food. 
I just feel like it’s not fast food. It’s another level
Created new poll 'Smash/5 guys': https://s.groupme.com/cnWY3Vk
1. Smashburger classic smash (does smash/five guys count? I forget. 2nd choice is a chicken burrito at qdoba with rice, black beans, queso, pico and hot salsa, fajita peppers, and cheese and sour cream)2. Taco Bell cheesy potato loaded griller (it’s like 2.79 so if that’s too expensive according to the jury let’s go with a hot n spicy from McD)3. Goodtimes wild fries 4. Smashburger chocolate malt and Cinnabon delights from Taco Bell (it’s a tie)5. Chipotle pibb. Qdoba is better overall but the Chipotle Pibb just hits different 
Oh yeah baby here comes the Great One. The Shadrach
Let’s just say it’s big. 😉
I get white and brown rice, chicken, pinto beans, veggies, lots of hot salsa, corn, cheese, lettuce. 
Don’t be silly, double wrap your willy
Well you see they can’t wrap my burrito with just one tortilla.
Jake, why the double wrap? I’m intrigued 
Jackson this was an amazing idea!! 
That's the point
Bois that’s like 3000 calories...
1. Double wrapped chipotle Burrito2. McDonald’s hamburger only extra pickle3. CFA Fries, Fresh with buffalo sauce4. DQ mint Oreos milkshake 5. A circle K blue and yellow Powerade
After everyone lists their meals I’ll figure out which items/restaurants are best represented. It’s going to be a dogfight between CFA and McDees
Hot and Spicy coming in strong
Ok that makes it so much easier. 1. Chipotle Steak Butrito2. Hot and Spicy3. CFA Fries. If you don’t eat them with CFA sauce then go to hell.4. CFA frosted leamonade5. THE McDees Dr.Pepper
I haven't eaten dinner, this is horrible
Brown rice, black beans, chicken, fajita veggies, extra pico, verde, white queso, maybe sour cream. Depends on the day
Yeah I would do a Qdoba burrito chicken, guac, lots of cholula sauce
My first round draft pick is burrito bowl, side changed to large bag of chips
I think Chipotle is in
Created new poll 'Chipotle count?': https://s.groupme.com/7ueP24y
Invest in Door Dash now boys
Oh man. That would be crazy if everything was still shut down in June I sure hope not
Jackson I don’t know. Did we say chipotle is out? I missed the consensus
By*
Buy bachelor party y￼ou mean door dash it over zoom?
@John Hammond The strips are baller man. I anxiously await your dream list
For Ben's bachelor party we should take the time to get everyone their dream order
1. Still deciding2. Hot n spicy3. CFA fries (with a￼ caveat, they must be eaten right away.)4. CFA oreo milk shake5. Lemonade Rockstar from a gas station
Add Guacamole and you got me a burrito
I don’t make the rules
7.25 for a burrito and 2 for a drink? Right at 10
A solid burrito soda combo is running you $10+ now adays
You can do that at chipotle?
Can’t happen at 5 guys
Like a 5$ difference. You need to be able to walk out of the place with a full meal for under $10 I’d say.
I’m distraught 
BETTER THAN THE NUGS!!!!!!! What the hell is happening right now?????
There’s a difference between chipotle and smash. 
I don't know, then I should be able to do smash burger
I just had the strips tonight. Better than the Nuggs 
Yes
Does chipotle bowl count as a menu item?
Recently I’ve been vibing  with the 4 piece strips from CFA. honestly that is underrated in my opinion. 
Bro that Chipotle Pibb hits different. I don’t know what it is 
Pibb >= Dr. Pepper > all else
I've told you that before
What is this Pibb bulls*** do I even know my own friends?
Theres one in Rexburg, and its expensive but pretty bomb
I can’t remember the last time I had 5 guys
Strictly fast food. Baller picks 🔥
1. Baconator (If its strictly fast food, otherwise Bacon Smash)2. Hot-n-Spicy3. 5 Guys large fry4. Mcflurry 5. Chipotle Pibb
Mine is: CFA Spicy Sandwich, McDouble, Arby’s fries, Cinnabon Delights, and Chipotle Pibb Xtra 💧💧💧
Anyways, it got me thinking:WHAT IS YOUR DREAM MEAL: you get one menu item, (ie Whopper) one value item (ie McDouble) one side item (fries) one dessert (shake?) and one drink. GO
John: Arbys is gross
I’ll keep my opinion of Arby’s to myself this time
Alright boys, I want all of your responses on this one. This is a big deal. Here is the backstory: tonight, Kori and I couldn’t decide on Arby’s or CFA so we combined our favorites. This was the result. This s*** belongs in a museum somewhere

As long as it’s for you, it’s fine right?
I feel like you’ve asked this before...
Is it normal for couples to get professional photos like this of their wives? Asking for a friend
But Logan you are very right I had those same thoughts when I saw this
Unlike Shad I love naked girls 
Lol no, now is the PERFECT time
It’s weird if you follow her now, wait a day 😂😂 
@Zach Preator Just send it, follow for follow
Lol Adam 
I always knew shad hated naked girls
I don’t see any proper etiquette in that picture
Everything shads against in a photo 😂
Ya I’m just not gonna comment 
Also, why the Detroit RedWings of all teams and sports?
Or... she got paid for it? Potentially?
The LGBTQ stuff she posts wild. Some of the craziest stuff I’ve ever seen 😂 but she gets all the praise, mostly from Broomfield people smh
Reasons to become a photographer?
She paid someone for this
But like this is a semi pro photo shoot we’re taking about here
She’s nuts. I follow her cause I think it’s really funny when she complains about her LGBTQ+LMNOP bull crap
Good hell 😂
If she keeps posting stuff like this I’ll start following her
Yeah man idk if you guys follow her but she’s been off the rails for a few years now
Good ol’ Mike Gough
Is that Michael Gough following her?
Isn’t she bi?
We gonna talk about this or nah?

So we got our sneak peek back from our photographer... 😍
Let me screen shot in peace
I hate you guys
Thanks. I found it myself
Nice meme Zach 
Dude I want to see that Final Four match up. Yale v BYU. Good fundamentals and lots of 3s!!! And white guys.... 
That was beautiful. We should just simulate it every year
I will tell my son that’s how it actually happened. I expect you all to play along

Guys my investment killed it today!!! 🤪
I think Utah falls within that first category
As long as CO allows it, looks like you can still get sealed Ben 
Yeah its just gonna get weirder over the next couple of weeks
*small sigh of relief*
Sick. On base restrictions suck
We WILL be there for that civil wedding though. 
Atleast then even if the temples are closed I could get civilly married and then we can travel together to my next base
Yessir
Nice. Still graduating at the same time?
So I just got briefed this morning, they’re keeping the seniors here and sending the other classes home and we are just gonna push full steam towards graduation and be restricted to base essentially 
This is beautiful 
Brutal
The Shammy is special. It’s almost like it’s own little holiday season. Nacho Fries and all their other stuff is unreliable, sporadic, lazy, and unnecessary. 
Very different. They at least warn us and make it a good time. We are ready for it, and it’s reliable every year. We never know when or if any Taco Bell items come back. They took away my griller, may she Rest In Peace. Plus who wants Shammy’s all year long? I’d get sick of them. 
Shamrock shakes? Monopoly?
In similarly devastating news: Taco Bell took away their nacho fries again. I’m kind of sick of the stupid marketing ploy at the expense of the consumer. McDonalds and Jack in the Box would never ❤️
You would look absolutely smashing in a wedding dress
Well I Was supposed to come to Idaho and Utah for engagement photos and wedding dresses and stuff but that’s probably not going to happen now...
Tomorrow is Friday the 13th...
Yeah I said that as a joke but that would be devastating 
I just hope it doesn’t affect your wedding at all
Yeah, my school is probably going to quarantine all of us in our barracks starting after this weekend to try and keep us healthy and keep us from the rest of the city
Sorry Ben. Looks like no wedding
Insane
What’s crazy is that the have advised bishops to get members the sacrament once a month. That makes it sound like this thing is going to last 👀

Going from like 6 til probs 9-9:30
The reception is the night of the wedding at my house
Is the reception that night?
Afternoon, like 4 pm but we should plan on being there like 3
Ben what time of day is the commish ceremony?
Costa Vida for lunch is the plan rn
Any way we could push it back a little? I'm thinking 11:00
9:30 am
9:30 PM I hope

Fort Collins temple
Best day ever
So just wanting to confirm with everyone, my wedding will be Saturday June 6th at 0930. You’re all invited of course

I would have been okay if he had a bigger part. I like the character
The only thing he did was help Poe escape the First Order and was like moral support the rest of the trilogy
I feel like (unfortunately) the “they wouldn’t have won without him” is also correct. He kind of started the whole thing really. So he wasn’t useless, but he was definitely annoying lol

I just want to remind everyone that this is all Shad’s fault. 
That’s actually really impressive
Pic to prove it bois
Here’s how you know that it’s not real. He spelled bois with a Y. A mistake I would never make 
I the real John Hammond am not engaged 
Oh yep I can tell it’s Zach because he is liking every message
Just like when I got my mission call to Montana
It’s like the mission call all over again
What is going on!!! 🤯🤯🤯
Zach is John
But I’d feel like an absolute ass if it was actually John and this is how I’m reacting
This doesn’t even help me anymore 
I think Shad is John, and whoever is John is saying John got engaged 
Everyone needs to change their names back 😂 
Wait, who am I talking to. 
Pics or it didn’t happen 
Hells ya brother!
Just be happy for me
Sorry Shad, didn’t know you were so against marriage
Ill kill you
Boys, guess who’s engaged
We’ve made a triangle 
Sup my niqqas 
I find the names highly amusing

Tell me this picture doesn’t get you guys emotional. We used to collect these obsessively. I just bought the 32-team pack for 15 bucks on amazon. I couldn’t resist. 
@Jackson Esplin Smashburger has the “classic smash” and five guys has generic “hamburger” and “cheeseburger” items but neither has self-titled burgers on the menu 
CFA...
Shad complimenting Shads post
Like, the original? Same with 5 guys? I just didn’t know what they were called
Isn’t there a burger called The Smash Burger? 
Careful, he’s a college graduate 
This guy thinks critically ☝🏻
The problem I’m having here is the words ‘Signature Sandwich’. I would personally say the Whopper out classes the Big-Mac but the McDonald’s menu as a whole is better the BK. So just putting on Smashburger or Five guys whole menu vs one item I don’t think fits
You blessed man 
Smash all the way. 
I voted Baconator, but it could have easily been smash, 5 guys, or CFA. McDonald’s DQP is life though, much better than the big Mac 
I’m going to email GroupMe. I do not want these to be anonymous 
These polls are brutal. Making me choose between good burgers/sandwich’s is criminal
Created new poll 'What is the best signature sandwich?': https://s.groupme.com/3qIyMu
Just an idea for that special woman in any of y’alls lives
The trolly car problem episode legit saved my grade in philosophy 
So good.
I love that show 
Glad to see Logan is making good use of his extra daylight savings time
An all-timer for sure
A true masterpiece

I’m not actually Zach so blame Shad for that meme
Is that bird... going... to abort that baby???
What’s a Luigi board
I can’t take off the 2 until Shad changes his name back
If you type in @z it will say under their name who is who
Shad is Zach Preator
So who’s Shad?
I got you fam. That’s most of the reason I posted it here Is because I know you would appreciate it
I’m just impressed Zach posted a baseball meme ❤️
I have to type in @z every time I wanna know which is which...
No. Shad took my name when I switched so I can’t switch all the way back
So did Shad just post that?
This meme has come a long way
This must end 
Hi confusion, I’m dad
I am confusion. 
Nice avatar Zach 
Sup boys 
I think there’s probably a lot worse out there
Reasons I’ll never be a General 😭
Imagine if one of us ran for public office and this group chat was discovered 
Jeez Shad
Too young? Is that possible? 
Over the last 3 days I watched episodes 1,2, and 3. Padme is a straight babe in episode 2. HOWEVER, I can’t stand her in episode 3, and she looks too young in episode 1. 
As far as straight up looks go, sure, but I think she’s annoying in the movies. 
Not a fan of Rey. 
Qi’ra Rey padme. 
Shut your whore mouth
1439827. Rey
Disagree but respect 
1. Jyn, 2. Qi’ra, 3. Padme 
Also, I asked Katie and she agrees with me that Emilia Clark is the best with padme a close second place
Also Zach that video was hilarious 
I think I convinced Katie to have us go as padme and Anakin for Halloween. ￼
Oh she does seem to be on top of a lot of things in that movie

I’d rather be in Japan
I’m at bishopric meeting
All weekend long baby. Even missed school on Friday. 
Training? On a Sunday morning?
Nice. 
Japan
Where are you?
It’s 9:45 pm...
Why are y’all up at 6 am on a Sunday?
Thank you, thank you.
The Sunday McFlurry comment made me pee a little I was laughing so hard
After reading all 50 comments this morning, Zach’s got the funniest stuff. Well done overall, gang
Thank you all for allowing me to continue my procrastination for my 18 min talk I have to give tomorrow that I’m just now starting... 
Your love is my award. 
Anyone who can get me to contribute this much to a group chat deserves an award 
Well done Jake 
Sunday? Don’t tell anyone, but McFlurry.
Our go to was the faithful McFlurry. Had a bad day? McFlurry. Had a great day? Celebrate with a McFlurry. Just a day? Make it exciting with a McFlurry. 
It was big in my mission. I always got the Hershey’s pie. Phenomenal 
No jackson that’s the one close I know
Same on the mission
I think that one was the closest @Jackson Esplin 
I actually went a bunch on my mission. BK was the only place that had free refills on drinks
I only really started going because there’s one on base and they have them in japan 
I never went as a kid, the only one I can think of was the one on 120th and Main. Was there one closer?
Yeah I would put Bk fries in the top three
Not the best but still good 
No Shad you’re have always been a big advocate for BK
And their fries are pretty good too
I only have one thing against Burger King and that is the concept that every burger is char broiled which is just not how I like my burgers! It’s not as juicy. Additionally the question at hand was French fries, not chicken fries... although I do go hard on some Burger King breakfast. 
Burger King breakfast has quickly become one of my favorites among the fast food kings
Zach’s right I can afford good chicken nuggets. 
*not poor enough for Burger King 
Ya I get it you’re too good for Burger King 
I knew this was coming ^^
No one ever gives Burger King any credit. Shiz is super cheap and good quality for how cheap it is. Whopper can compete with ANY FAST FOOD BURGER OUT THERE. 10 nuggs for a buck fifty (although admiddetly their nuggets kinda suck but still), Chicken fries are bomb, they have good mozzarella sticks, good desserts, and honestly their breakfast is top notch. Give me those croissantwiches and French toast sticks any day of the week 
Same^^
First place I went after my mission 
CFA is probs one of the first places I’ll go once I’m back in the states
Frosted lemonades are fire. But I’m with Jackson Dr P ever day 
Frosted lemonade is pretty good too
I’ve never had CFA’s frosted beverages. Their Dr P is way too good to get something else. I’ll have to try them
Yo, I do have to say though, the fact that CFA got rid of the frosted sunrise had me up in arms. It was better than orangeJulius and I would buy on every day if they still had it
I’ve said it before, CFA like Taylor Swift and country music. Technically, Taylor is (or used to be) country music, but let’s be honest, she’s on a different level. It’s impossible for me to compare McDonalds and CFA because CFA is just on a different level
Well you better hurry because if John has his way, you’ll be out of luck
My go-to is the buffalo chicken slider. Unreal. They also have a pizza one that I go to when I’m looking for something different. 
I am glad we had this conversation because I didn’t know about the slider
McDonalds and Wendy’s have their flaws for sure. That is why you are one of my most respected fast food consultants. Any passionate fast foodie needs to be able to critique ❤️❤️❤️ 
I am also a harsh critic of fast food over all. McDonald’s and Wendy’s have some pretty bad things in my eye too. The only place on that list where I think nothing is gross to me is chick-fil-a
I don’t get their meals, and I’m not a sandwich meat guy, so I respect you. But their sliders are phenomenal, and different than anything you can get at most other fast food. And they’re $1 dollar each after 9pm. I’ll personally take you and buy you’re meal, give it one more chance. It’s right up there with the big dogs
I will give credit where credit is due and say the fries are the best thing they have but it’s not saying much. I have given Arby’s like 3 legit tried and have come away every time very disappointed. The meat feels like you are chewing on rubber their cheese looks like it could survive nuclear winter and the buns are really weird and hard. I don’t know the beef curtains aren’t for me.
Yeah @John Hammond 
@John Hammond Ok I gotta hear why you don’t like Arby’s
Honestly I’ll just be happy to be eating potatoes in any form 
I wish I could see who voted for what so I could know who not trust anymore 
If I could eliminate one fast food chain from the world Arby’s is the one to go 
Arby’s curly fries are arguably the best seasoned food in history
Right? And curly fries are a different ball game altogether 
It’s complicated. McDonalds fries are best... but CFA fries WITH CFA sauce are unrivaled. 
It’s about to get heated... 
Created new poll 'Best French fries 🍟 and why....': https://s.groupme.com/2ISeFGy8
Anyone can do a poll. But I agree
You should do more polls
For research. 
All these post are making me want to watch Star Wars. 
I’ll also give credit where credit is due
I’ll give it you @Logan Camilletti. Qi’ra is a close second for me
@Ben Pagel It’s been a good day for the memes... 
Also, I’ll be in Utah from December 16-19
Jake coming in with the wholesome memes
“Shadratchet”
Reddit is seriously￼ ruthless
A bit haha 
That hurts your karma
Being a conservative on reddit 
Good meme day
It feels good to be represented in the meme community. 
This is all I can think about when I read “shoot the jizz and out you is”
The best movie!!!! 
What movie was she in?
I didn’t vote because this is my favorite! 
Traitor
You’re welcome 
2 min til close
PADME TAKES A COMMANDING LEAD
One of my darkest mutuals ever...
Haha that’s what it was a before and I’ll fight you like we did at dodgeball all those years ago
I’ll break your neck if you say jyn
I’ll break the tie
The answer is no, you can’t see who voted for Leia. 
We could just do a tie breaker
I’m not sure actually 
Will we see who voted what when it expires?
I was about to say the same thing
Winner will be the group profile pic for the rest of the year
One person didn’t vote. You’re the tie breaker. Pls vote
On the real though, Padme is the best all around. Change my mind
I change my vote to Jar Jar Binks ❤️💦💦💦
For sure, rogue one is my favorite movie. 
Rogue one just blew my mind. Also she’s hot
(Actresses in general)
Not for me friend. Emilia Clark is top 5 all time for me
Qi’ra flew under the radar 
I choose 80’s leia over jyn
It’s only because rogue one was a bigger hit than solo 
Thank you!
Fight me
Ok, but in what world is jyn better than qi’ra?
Honestly I struggle to choose just one. Obviously a Huge fan of padme and the prequels (the coliseum scene ❤️). But Rey man... also Emilia Clark... 
It’s Padme, and it isn’t close. Even if she is a pedo
Guys this is very important. Please vote and debate.

That’s the weakest section of the bracket, no one could beat them
Jack in the box made it far 
This is mine. The bracket is stacked on the left side. It made for some of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make

Sorry the pic is kind of lame. It looked a lot clearer on the big screen. Kori and baby are healthy and everything looks good so far. 
It is what you think it is. Wanted it’s uncles to know before we told everyone in a few weeks. April 29th ❤️

I hate them!
I slaughtered them like animals!

Except those kankles... @Jon Michael Ossola 
I don’t recognize any of those people.
Andie wouldn’t see those shoes for months
We love you @Shad Karlson 
I loved that blog 
Fine all be the one to say it. She is Mckensie Sims
If this was made after the wedding she was still probably salty with us😂
That was rough. I love how she didn’t even put in the effort to find any pictures of us.

If you look closely above my meme you can see the stupid insta sex bot comment 🙏🏻
Couple throwbacks but still great
Well worth it to have Rey ziplocks
You best believe pat and Merlene will be there Jake 
Bruh, try 11:00
To answer above questions, I’m 100% there and Kori is a 97.8% there. 
That’s an OG Larry move
Oh dang. What a weird way to focus
So he had his mom put a block on it that way he could focus more I guess. He is going to ask his mom to put the code in so he can get back on the chat
I don’t know. Can he just like reset his password?
If I removed him and added him again, would he be able to see everything before that?
I will get on it
We just need to find a way to get JM back on 
Ya I’m good with that. 
I enjoy the GroupMe chat

I kind of like that it’s separate from my messages
We could just use iMessage 
Do we all have iPhones??
Lol. What
Locked 
So Jon Michael locker himself out of the group chat.... 
Wednesday night for sure
Strip clubs though?
Jon Michael has that! I think logistically Wednesday nigh would make the most sense. 
Bachelor party?
It will be Thursday around noon then the reception that night. 
Wednesday night, returning Thursday night. Hahah. School. 
Also Jake, what time is the sealing
So logistically when would you guys leave/get back to Provo?
I’ll for sure be there and Ashtyn will be there if she can get work off!
Dang man!! We’ll see if she can! 
Laura’s work schedule is set like 6 months in advance so probably not
Are you guys bring the wife’s/girlfriends 
Man we could rent a massive van 😂
Or the Shad wagon with Super Nintendo hook ups 
Or a sweet rental car...
Anyone have a suburban we could borrow? 
If only we had a huge car we could all fit in
LEGENDARY
Drive down here. Stay the night, then come with us 
Who wants to fly John and I out
Jackson and I are Road tripping from Provo. It gon be lit
Man we are just teasing our boy Shad no worries! 
Sorry about the Thursday guys. It’s the only date the reception place had. Just want you all to know that the Reception will be litty just like the kitty in the city! 
So we don’t even have to show up!
We can do FaceTime with multiple people now
Who’s gonna hold the phone so I can FaceTime for the temple ceremony🙃
On a Thursday? What are you, Shad?
Boys save the date. 14th of November... ☺️ in Colorado.

But I’m also on the prosthetic train 🚂 
It entirely depends on my age. Roaring 20’s? Hell no, I’m doing chemo. 45? Probably not having sex anyway
No prosthetic

Are you a 10% kind of guy?

Laughed harder than I should have 
My fav is Hon Dipo for sure
The Mak Donals one is stupid accurate 
This is awesome haha
My mom still has them on the fridge.. 
Did I really look that bummed to get married? Could I see the future?
This is the coolest thing ever. You even got Shad’s nipple in there. Very tasteful. 
You still have those things? I throw them away once they get married 
Legendary 
Since we are taking our engagement pics tomorrow we thought we could use a couple ideas. Thanks guys! 
I just got called in to kiss and then I left if I remember correctly
I remember not being invited
Man that was the day when Scarlett got all mad because she was embarrassed doing those scenes with Shad with us all watching. Good freaking times.

I almost didn’t recognize it without penises on it
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie
I think it’s funny that some white mom probably just google searched “Jesus” and put the first 8 pictures she found
@John Hammond My point exactly. They all belong ❤️
I’m surprised they got away with a meme on a program
Can confirm
Bottom center I think is obi wan kenobi

Zach and Laura in like 10 years
Coming up for air?
Welcome back
Sah dude 
My man
Sup boys 
It’s about time
Just finished The Office all the way through for the first time.... what is life. 😢😭😭😭😭
Leaving the meme game was your first mistake. Things are temporary. But memes? Memes are forever.
I’m back in the meme game and it feels so good
4 Shad
You serious??
^^^^^^
Bro they’ve always had that
There is only one restaurant that could top the value of the Wedny’s 4 for 4, and it was Wendy herself. This looks unreal 🔥🔥
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard 😅🤣
We’ve been on a roll tbh. It’s gotta be the fact that there’s one less virgin in the chat. We’ve evolved. 
The memes lately 
Found some absolute gems last night 
When the gazers made the wedding picture table *nut*
Anyone in co for the reception?
Any car accidents?
We found your fortune @Shad Karlson 
https://youtu.be/UaEC-lWSlmIThis song perfectly describes how Shad’s feeling about tonight 
So where’s post lunch lunch at?? 
When you’re sitting with Shad’s mission president and he describes Shad as: “on time, reliable, and hardworking”
I wish I was there :(
He did it. 
Shad right now
@Shad Karlson Don’t forget your “son block”
22 hours, hopefully not 2 hours
Shad tomorrow night waiting for Ashtyn to get ready...
Under 24 hours
25 hours Shad. You got this
Little over 24 hours till shad catches supa hot fire

#prayforshad
Sorry, I’m working with a network defense company and we are doing threat path analysis and it’s all in python (some virus called triton) and I was gonna ask for help but I figured it out
Me too. What’s your question?
✋
Anyone know anything about python?
Gonk Droid FTW ❤️
That’s gold jerry, gold
May we keep him in our hearts 
Hmmmmmm
https://youtu.be/MwRxJymy5Ho
Oh snap
Just like you did in smash?
For a tournament that never happened
Are you suggesting a rematch?
Nig I’ll meat you any day
You must be saying that because I bounced you in the 2nd round 
I knew I wasn’t good enough to beat Logan 
We didn’t. Either Sam or Lydia said it was there group of friends did it while we all were gone but used our names for some reason
Same
I still have absolutely no recollection of that tournament.
Still here
You’re on vacation in Hawaii and the only thing you feel to send to us is a picture of your poop?!
^^^^^^^^
Good heavens 
This left me the other day.. 👍🏽👌 #solid
Just printed it and painted it. On the next I’ll do a little sanding
Did you design it too? Or just print it?Either way, we’ll done Leslie well done!
Yoooooooo
Finished
Reminds me of that time in Jackson’s basement when Ben scored the 2 pointer.... if you know what I mean. 🙈
Some people are honestly so dumb

How are we not friends? 
What’s y’alls snapchats? Mines jake_linford
A true Larry
I don’t know why I enjoy this picture so much
It was just really groundbreaking I guess
And you guys thought my adoption meme was bad
This one is a little more edgy and might make y’all feel uncomfortable. This is my intention.
With hair!
Collin!
Sorry, I meant Reusch 
You actually look JUST like the Otterson girl that’s a senior in HS. Don’t remember her name. Dixie or Georgia.
😂😂😂
No wonder I went to japan 🙃
You look Asian!
She may not be the prettiest, but I hear she’s a freak ;)
I didn’t say he WAS like her. Dang.
But I see it.
Don’t disrespect JM like that she a b****
JM kinda looks like captain Marvel
Forgot to mention I had panda today too! 
Logan!! Funny you mentioned Walmart that’s where I picked up Ailyn, right there on aisle 69.... 😉
This is my partner, Keith. 
YES
Got it!!
IT is on it
❤️❤️❤️
Gotta love the drive Zach has
Camel_spaghetti
What is your Snapchat name
Weird
Jake, Ailyn straight up looks like a guy I saw at walmart
Logan, do you have version 10.56.1.1
We are missing Logan JM and Ben. 
ITS PERFECT
🍆💦💦💦
Soooo weird.

It looks like this 
It is the greatest shirt. 
It’s on there. It’s got little eyelashes next to it
Dude I have that shirt!!!!
Haha, just downloaded it... and made an account. Just for this!
I look like I’m 40
Maybe update the app?
Is there even a filter on that you stud😘
Guys I can only become a burly man! Where’s the woman at?
Yeah dude the girl to guy one is way creepy 😂
Ailyn... 😳
I AM dating you❤️
I’d date me
This is killer 😂😂😂😂 SHAD I CANT TAKE IT MAN SEND IT OVER
Gorilla hand there
😂😂😂
She looks like a real dude!
Kori’s hits a different level of horrifying
I’m a fat man and an even fatter woman
I need to get a snap reel quick
Zach looks like he has a great personality
@Logan Camilletti Should photoshop all of us beautiful women into the same group picture
We have to get it for the wedding!! 👌
I don’t know what it’ll look like, but I fully intend on getting Shad’s blown up full size and putting it next to my bad. We anxiously await you @Shad Karlson 
I make a freaking hot chick!!!  
Bro 😂😂😂😂
CHASE 😂
Freaking creepy.
Everyone post a pic with the new snap filter. I want to see you all.
Who’s in Colorado tomorrow 
Survival*
Yeah there’s only one way to leave survivor training early... 
Yeah, unlikely... :(
It doesn’t seem likely that he’ll be able to leave survival training early 
Ya the survival training ends June 22nd 
I will be there for that for sure
There’s an open house in CO on Saturday June 22nd 
Oh yeah, he has survival training doesn’t he?
Understandable, Sam may not even be able to come 
I was thinking it was julyyyyy 😭
The department of homeland security is sending me to San Francisco to try and work a deal with a network defense company there but I don’t get back until that Friday night. I might try and work my travel dates to come back earlier but it’s a long shot at best
Military stuff?
BEN NO
FML
June 20th 
Shad, when is the wedding again?
I’m down
Can I like @John Hammond idea 3 times?
I love Nudes. Their Mac n Cheese is one of my all-time favorite menu items of any fast food place. But you’re right, their location is tough here too. Right next to Cafe Rio and Panda.
Let’s see it for Shad bachelor party!
Guys I saw Get Out. Have you guys seen Get Out?
Get out, really?!
Did you guys know that Jackson saw get out?
Noodles is super underrated. I would have gone more in high school had it not been next to the doba
I’d be nothing without you guys 🙏🏻
Boo
F u Shad 
It just won’t feel right.
Panda 
I can’t have this end in a draw. 
I second panda*
Nudes
Noodles
I second that.
Panda
Alright gentlemen, this is what this chat is for: Panda or Noodles & Co?
That’s what life is right now 
We should all defs be in the same retirement home.

I honestly can’t breathe right now
What is wrong with you
https://www.instagram.com/p/BxDj5F5BIPy/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1in31vkoskt8y
Regardless John got left out last time so we’ll have to all get together. Are you seeing your girlfriend Ben?
Do it for the food Ben 
Very true
No one ever has fun staying at married couple places. Ask any of our siblings. Food is much better tho
Your good at place too. Probably more fun than the married couple 
I’m coming in Thursday May 16th and staying through that Sunday morning :)
You’re always welcome at our place
Question. Can I crash on someone’s couch? 😅
I’m here to party
I’m here to
I’m coming in 2 weeks
I’m not there yet
I get off at 6 BB❤️
Anyone here in Rexburg rn?

Saw this today... 
Clapping is only allowed on opening night. 
Those are the same people who clap when the plane lands
The worst. 
Also I’m sick and tired of people clapping every time there’s a turning point. 
@Jackson Esplin I agree. I actually liked captain marvels movie, but I did not like her in endgame
Me
Who hasn’t seen it on here?
Listen, I love the funny stuff, the characters are great, but I hated everything else about that movie. Holy crap 
Jackson why are you on GroupMe... its your anniversary!!! 
Except Captain Marvel. B**** 😂
Popular opinion: Logan doesn’t know anything about films or the quality thereof
I wouldn’t change a thing.
You kidding? I freaking loved it.
Why would you say that
Don’t kill my dreams like that
Endgame is a waste of time.
Happy late anniversary @Jackson Esplin ❤️
Happy birthday!
Love you Zach 
Thanks BB
We love you Zachary ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ HBD
Thanks! 
Yo, HBD Zachary!
The best is Stanley’s face!!
Hey guys, not a spoiler, but google thanos and click on the gauntlet
I don’t see it until Monday
It was good 
I saw it 
And I’m going to see it tonight!! LETS GO
Haha if you are feeling like a rebel, just look on YouTube for “avengers endgame leaked footage” anddd it’s the ending is there 😂👍
I will kill anyone who says anything
Harry Potter kills Thanos
Has anyone seen the avengers movie yet?
Any of you could have married her.
She just got a job in Wisconsin starting at $70,000
Hey that’s my cousin
Sharon made it to the mechanical Engineering gram page
The great shad-uate!

Chic Fil A > Taco Bell
Its times like these when I wish I had a cup holder adapter for these bad boys
Of course I do 
Shad doesn’t read our messages 😭
We should do our own
The real question is how did White Castle make it to the elite 8 they should have been in the NIT!!! 
In and out > Popeyes
For sure. Chipotle is my laiife 
Raising Cain’s was a great upset
Over McDonalds though? 
Amen Logan 
Otherwise I pretty much agree
I’d have chipotle taking it all. 
I personally think CFA is a no brainer, and Popeyes had no business being in the final 4. They had a very easy bracket.
What are your thots?^^
Guys through the fire and flames is actually a really good song. 
In case you guys had questions about black holes
Nice. Would like twice
Major crossover meme. LOTR, Spider-Man, and NASA
What about Jackson’s night out? Oh sorry we tee peed Ben for his birthday.. 😉
Man. I’m glad I had you guys 
No it I wish would have spelt in Cadillac! Much more room than my Civic 
Legendary. 
All I remember is Zach and I got locked out of Shad’s house and slept in the trunk of the Malibu 
And Logan and I slept in my dads
I thought you slept in her car?
That’s also the same day I got my mission call!
Is that also the night me and her slept in my car and I walked I walked in to seminary late? 
Man we just got out of the temple and this is the greatest thing to see on my phone after a spiritual high
John is a legend 😍
I don’t know. The music was pretty loud
Very denied 
And the durfs can neither be confirmed nor denied. 
21 pilots AND bastille. 
And it was 21 pilots 
Wow wow wow there was no durfing involved!
Zach that night is what brought us together, having John and scarlet dry humping in the back and listening to bastille. SOO GOOD
#roadto400
Ok that’s about enough of this 
Or that time my poor innocent cousin Faith had to watch Shad and Scarlett make out in the back of the car 😂😂
@Ben Pagel  that was hilarious 😂 we literally spent an hour just running into each other full speed
Or that time John made out with Scarlett in the back of my car on the way to Ft Collins at 3 in the morning
And none of us will ever forget that one night driving around in Jackson’s car 😅
I’ll never forget Jackson and I going to the church gym with Kenzie and her dad and practicing taking a charge so Jackson could win points with her 😂😂
Asking Ari to Prom while Shad and I blared Damn Yankees in the background 😂 that was the first time I really noticed Kori. Maybe the first time I’d even seen her
Payson is still alive and well. She yearns for the Gazers.
It’s funny because as I looked on Facebook today I got a memory. It was when I asked Ari to Prom junior year. I spelt prom with the “p” backwards... #nerves
And listening to country in Jackson’s❤️
I remember sitting in Sabrina’s truck before school talking about It
It was comparable to Dwight v Andy!
Or should I say he had 2nd place locked up pretty early haha
Not really lol, Logan has it locked up pretty early 
The Shad and Logan showdown for Sabrina. What a battle.
I love you guys ❤️❤️
“D for P”
“Wait for me”
The memories
Worst night ever. Jason and Teri has a fit. 
And they made out for 15 minutes a block away from their house before turning the corner? And when shad pulled roses from the trunk? 😂👍
Man Ben and Andie are the reason we are Gazers today! Legend indeed
And let’s not forget that time we all asked Scarlett to Prom for Shad
What about Ben and Andie?
John and Andy right before her mission
Haha I try not to remember these 😅
😂😂😂
Jon Michael making out with Andie and Scarlett in the hot tub? Legend.
I forgot about that
Jon Michael and Kenzie???
#MeToo
Right after shad was through with her
Same 
My all time favorite is John and Scarlett. It’s not even close. 
I’m both proud and disgusted 
Zach was 2 days away from a perfect week. Straight up dawg
You kissed man crotch, I tried to NCMO fallyn, Jackson had Maddie B,  Shad had Scarlett and on and on
Good times, nonetheless. 
We all made mistakes
Beyond questionable! People were going around calling this girl man-crotch and I still did it. Haunts me to this day
Whenever I drink a bottle of cold DP or Pibb, I’m taken back to the Paul Derda rec center where @John Hammond and I made some very questionable first kiss decisions. The nostalgia. 
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9WKRmnJoU/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=bz3vex1sukoc
It’s on FB in my memories. It’s a screenshot
Jackson is that screenshot? I just went there in her gram to like Shad’s comment but it’s gone
Hasn’t changed a bit
C O R N
I’m down. Wasn’t Chris Evans originally the flame guy
MCU is gonna have fantastic 4 and x men now though so I’m pumped for that 
I had that thought the other day. “Wow, after endgame, avengers is finally over.”“Wait, definitely not”
Disney is becoming dangerous 
P r o f I t  D r i v e n 
They’re gonna keep making avengers movies with captain marvel as the new face 
These movies aren’t going anywhere 
Lol Captain Marvel is the 21st movie in the MCU and it still raked in over a billion dollars globally 
Gonna be lit. And smell terrible
Jackson you up for the 55 hour marathon?
I think the movies are fine and I’ll go and see them I am just tired of always hearing about them 
Kori is ready for it to be done too. Says it’s too repetitive. But I don’t care inject it into my veins 🔥🔥🔥
If we don’t have the hype what else is there 
Those are definitely my top two with ragnarok a close third
Maybe guardians of the galaxy 1
That shiz hasn’t been good since Ironman 1
It’s all hype. 
I’m there with you Logan
Why is that @Logan Camilletti 
Very unpopular. 
Unpopular opinion: I’m super excited for the avengers to be over

Open house June 22nd in Colorado!

@Shad Karlson When is your wedding?
That’s a strong finish. Well done!
Left 4 pins standing all game! 
Gents I give you a 184.. 
146 with a strike in the 9th.. heading into the 10th!!!
You’re gonna need a miracle boi
Get it
Sorry to interrupt your sleep but your boy is bowling the best game of his life. #roadto200
Did you see that Churi is in black and white on the posters? That was my one question eating at me... now I be ready 😍
Ohhh. I just realized that’s Andrew nuehoffen from high school...
Who’s pumped 
I wish I had Ben’s abs. 💦💦
Well... I wouldn’t stop looking also so there’s that
We went hot tubbing and he wouldn’t shut up about his abs
Reminds me of Ben Pagel still today
Shut up about your dad bod
I don’t know him but he pisses me off
Look closely at his face. The dude is breaking a sweat flexing so hard. Reminds me of our boy @Ben Pagel during whiffle ball season with Jake’s neighbor!
This will never not make me laugh 
@Shad Karlson 
Did you know the directors for arrested development are the ones that did infinity war
Arrested development?
Also good
You guys ever seen Community?
No doubt no doubt
But not as much as Office or HIMYM
Fantastic show. I like it better than Parks and Rec

It caught fire??
We may have lost a dear, dear friend and ally in the front lines of battle back home. It always had our backs in times of need. It always supplied goodness to our hungry souls. We played years and years of Monopoly together. The McDonalds by Shad’s house caught fire this week. We always wanted our McChickens spicy, but no that hot 😭😭🇺🇸🇺🇸

@Zach Preator #pipelineGA
The dream. 
When you get paired with shads brother for ministering 🙃😂
Down
They’re totally gonna give you dead guy duties just like in nacho libre 
Nope
Are you gonna be a high priest?
But he jokes around a lot
Nope. He’s 34
Or is he a grownup?
That’s pretty wild Zach. Is your other councilor a student too?
What really??? 
It’s in our married student ward
Is it in a YSA ward? Or a normal ward?
Thanks Ben 
^^^^^
Maybe I need to repent for something
I didn’t do anything
Second counselor in the bishopric 
I’m proud of you brother. Congrats, kind of
What the heck, just say ittttt
Let’s just say I should be a high priest
What it is?
Still hasn’t hit me yet
So... @Zach Preator when were you going to mention your new calling?
Ben. Shamrock Shakes. They’re here. They’ve returned. Once a year they come for a month. And it is glorious
TREAT YO SELF
Explain
Yaaaaaas
STOP EVERYTHING. SHAMMIES ARE BACK!!
Can confirm
Y’all are weird
At least 5000
How many furries at BYU IDAHO?
Assuming we get 7000 new students per year, sometime within the next 15 years we will have a gay killer
That’s BYU. I’m safe here at BYU northern campus
So there’s like a fifth of a gay killer out there. Be safe fam
Well if we agree on 6% gay and .01% murderers, then P(gay & murderer) = .06 * .0001 = .000006 or .0006%. In other words 1 in 166,667. 
1 gay murderer is among us, yes. 
Solid numbers. Soooo: gay murderers?
After some research I retract my 15%. It appears that on average in the United States, only 3.8% are outspokenly gay. At BYU I would expect that percentage to be less. But I’d bet that 6% or so would say they struggle with it.
😏
Taste the rainbow 
That’s a lot of rainbow Zach 
15% is 4500 ish
The only publicly out athlete at BYU. She’s very proud 😂 I’m going to go with..... 166. I would just say 160 but, Order 66. 
Haha. I guess a percentage of 15% total, 4% practicing/outspoken
Gottem 
At least one: Emma gee 
Good. I like it. Next: how many homosexuals?
That’s why I included the California part. My data is not inclusive. 
Yes Zach but it’s not a simple random sample; you can’t assume that the population of BYU students is representative of Utah’s population as a whole 
Man I didn’t even think about negligence. I’m going to go with 7 total. 
But self defense or negligent driving is probably more likely in Utah than elsewhere
Well statistically, BYU represents 1% of the population of Utah. In 2017 there were 73 murders in Utah which equates to about 0.75 students. However, if you assume students had murdered in a home state, such as California where there were almost 2,000 murders in 2017, then it could look more like 2 or 3. 
15,000
Nah. 2 murder. 3 self defense. First numbers to come to my head, take it to the bank. 
I’d say probably zero for murder, but self defense? Maybe military?
BYU has over 30,000 students. How many of them do you think have killed someone?

You didn’t send it to anyone?? 😭😭😭
I used to have it... but I don’t know where it went since the mish 😭
Guys, does anyone have that video of me pissing on the Broomfield eagle? Who can post it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3DtTGgOmM0
What’s the next best thing?
Scranton! -what? The electric city. Scranton! -what? The electric city
Don’t pretend like you haven’t always had one for shad... I know I have
Shad Karlson received a shoutout on the BYU hockey insta story as an “Enforcer” and now I’m sporting a partial. 🍆🍆🍆
That video is perfect. Huge facts. 
I didn’t like the kid thing though. Unless it was him and robin still together having a kid. 
I’ll watch it now 
It took me years to finally sit down and watch the final episodes bc I had heard the horror stories. It was just a year or so ago I finally suffered through it. 
The points you just said are exactly what the video says
I’ve read that it was the writers plan from the beginning, for Robin and Ted to get back together, but clearly they didn’t adapt to what the plot and characters did for the viewers. I hated that Barney and Robin broke up as well. Hated he reverted to his old self, but they salvaged him by giving him that daughter. That was perfect. It showed that at least a little change is possible.
Not to mention he failed his perfect month which is very uncharacteristic of him
Oh yeah don’t get me started on Barney. Let’s just give him a kid that will make him happy.
Video makes fantastic points and I agree 100% plot doesn’t make sense. The whole time you are told that Ted and Robbin are not good for each other and then you spend a season and half telling me to root for Barney and Robin for them to Beale up and Barney to go back to him old self and the Ted to be forced back with Robbin just doesn’t sit right
I was totally fine with them killing off Tracy and remarrying. Shit happens. But to just go crawling back to Robin ruined it all. It’s basically saying that Robin, just like the rest of Ted’s failed relationships, was always in the way and at the back of Ted’s head, and was always the one Ted truly wanted. I’m very passionate...
Haven’t watched the video yet, but Robin is at the top of my “most hated character in any show” list, and it isn’t close. She’s dirt. I’m anti last episode. It made the entire story of “how Ted met the mother” pointless. The part where Justin Russo tells Ted “yeah the whole point of your story is to ask us if it’s ok if you date Aunt Robin, and we say yes” was a knife to the chest for me. Poorly done. There is a “how it should’ve ended” out there. Audrey, who is also anti-last episode (shocker), showed it to me
Yes. I heard them. But my point is not totally opposite of his. I am pro the plot but I did not like the way it worked out so he is right that HIMYM “died”
Did you guys watch the video? He makes great points and has excellent insights
From the beginning I’ve never liked robin
Yes
Sooo a different person?
Like if robin was A. Hotter, and B. More likable it would have been better
I think the written plot was good, but with the actors portraying the characters the feel was off by the last episode. 
Yeah same👌
Tracy ❤️
As a very out spoken anti last episode person. Robin is not what we needed and the hero they needed was Batman not Robin
Not a fan of Robin
The second time through, I understood it better, but I still didn’t love it
I am pro last episode though. Its not what we wanted but its what we needed
Lol. Gotcha. YouTube is a full time job
No I did I meant who has time to make that
At least the first 4 min
Just watch it Zach. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVQbmDPkjBE&feature=shareThis guy speaks the gospel 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

Well all I have to say is Shad definitely reached up a few levels for that girl! 😱
I don’t see no ring on his finger *snaps  in z formation*
I’ll start, who the hell is that girl with you in the library? 
Ok ask away bishes 
What the hell is this
My face when I find out that stud is getting married
Thanks for the follow btdubs. It made my life 🔥
It has begun 🤤
😂😂😂
How long do you think you can keep up this heterosexual facade? *hold mic out*
Oh I’ll ask questions
Else it’ll look hella gay 
I’ll probably do the thing where people ask me questions but you guys will have to ask me some in case no one else does 
Suggestions? Requests?
Right? It’s like Christmas. I expect a helluva show tomorrow shad. 
I look forward to this ever year. Truly may favorite day 
Check out EspnU for the Air Force game tonight, ya boi is sittin court side so I’ll prolly be on tv

It’s like a 24 hour scavenger hunt race. Logan knows more than I do. 
What is this thing though?
Yes I did ;)
I’ll send pics in a sec
Ben but did you get a backpack??? 
We would all be pretty good at it. I’ll talk to Kori. April is crazy for us, I’d have to check the 5th and 6th
Jeez, that sounds like the military
But, you get a sweet backpack for signing up
Individual 
That goes for all of you, we would kill it together
35 per team or per individual
I think tix are 35$ right now
April 5,6 in SLC ya!
They have one in SLC right??
You and Kori should join us this year!
Yesh
Have you guys heard of the Cotopaxi Questival?
Jackson bringing my least 2 favorite things. Arby’s and country music 
Chic Fil A is far and beyond the best fast food place, and it isn’t close. But if you consider yourself a fast food enthusiast, you have to have the whole experience. CFA is so good, some wouldn’t even consider it fast food. If fast food were country music, CFA would be Taylor Swift. Sometimes you just have to settle for the places that make fast food... fast food These were my thoughts while eating my Arby’s. Thought I would share. 
Did you say 2 to 5 sliders for $1? Sounds like a freakin steal
Arby’s curliest will be in the celestial kingdom.
Ooh. Curly fries. 
Careful man, my curly fries are going to hear you
Anyone me who goes to Arby’s is not a friend of mine
They’re literally across the street from each other, so you can imagine the internal struggle. I almost got in a wreck and veered to the right. I was blessed to find from 2-5 sliders are just 1 dollar. Arby’s was the right choice. We are being looked out for gentlemen. All of us. 
Arby’s is the worst thing to ever happen to this world
I’m still boycotting 
Bulldog McDonald’s is ass 
A cheap and satisfactory one
Chick fil a
Arby’s 
McDonald’s
What kind of choice is that
Arby’s
Mc d
Arby’s or McDonalds. Hurry
Did someone call a plumber??
John remembers
Also thank you Ben🇺🇸
You’re welcome Zach 
Also thank you Logan for keeping us free🇺🇸
My moms making us go through my stuff and I found this. Not as good as ben’a but I haven’t changed
Not till 2020 probably
So I probably won’t wear them till it’s mandatory. Either Afghanistan or qatar
Are you getting deployed?!
Where overseas?
I won’t get them till I go overseas next summer. 
@Logan Camilletti Are they going to make you get OCPs even though you just got ABUs?
What can I say, been making power moves since day one

Ben right now...
Where are y’all
So Feel free to park in my driveway or in the Coldesac whenever y’all get here
Jackson you have to start at the halbisons and finish at the pages. It’s the only logical way
I think that’s when Shad is planning on getting there too
Ailyn and I will be there later like 10:30ish
We promised to be with the Halbs for NYE, but me Ari and Kori and going to be there for a bit for sure
Also, I already invited Andie, let me know if there’s anyone else I should invite

Let’s plan on 8 pm at my house
I love you guys!! ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘

Looks like I’m breaking up with Ailyn tonight then. 
Those who wait the longest receive the most. 
I just want to say thanks for butting me last. I have always brought up the rear...

Well that’s Emma for you she’s never been 100% straight forward with anything! 
It’s hard because it isn’t like... 100% straight forward. But I’m not really sure there is another way of interpreting it.
Naturally I don’t follow her so idk. But that would explain a lot 
So, did Emma Gee come out on Instagram?

Sounds like we’re coming down to Provo on the 20th of October for some sick reunions. Maybe Taco Bell crunch burritos? Haven’t been bowling in years. Plenty to do
Let me know and maybe I’ll try to take a long weekend and we’ll hit the YSA dance!!! 😉
Guys, this was a rough summer. I’m excited to come home ❤️ 🏠 
Oh trust me, I have the date circled. I call big spoon that night
FYI, I finally get done with my training on oct 6th. So I’ll be back in Provo in three weeks
For the record I also want to come❤️
I like how Zach said “Laura wants” that’s a sign of a good or whipped husband!! 👍🏽
The 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th are good for me. 😁
20th ??
Hey Laura wants to come down to Utah some time in October for some Halloween lights thing. Probably just a Saturday night. Would everyone have a Saturday night that works? 
Those with nacho fries and Cinnabon delights? It’s unstoppable
Stop it. 😍

So, conference weekend wouldn’t really work for me...It’s our anniversary weekend and we’ll be in park city. 
❤️
Always
John can I come
I’ll be in Provo 
^^ same
I think I’m gonna come out for conference
Me
Wish I could be there! We need to have a got together of some kind in October. Who’s gonna be in Provo next month?
 Bros!! We are going to have an open house, party thing this Saturday night at 5 at my house. Then I’m talking in church on Sunday. I know a lot of you guys can’t make it, if you can great. But please let your parents know. 
Year one is on Netflix!!!!! Life just got a little bit better :)
Only certain people mow in skinny jeans
Look at that boy - Grandma Ossola
Brothers I am back!!! 😘
100 percent
What are the chances Shad throws these gems up in the bachelor pad
Haha! We weren’t allowed in bmt, but here tons of guys have creepy staches 
We aren’t allowed to grow them except for March 
I’m literally so jealous
Just get it out of your system now
I thought you guys might want to see my AFI 36-2903 compliant mustache I’ve been working on for a month now. I’m pretty proud of it. 
A new blender. 
What does a man who has everything get for gifts?
Imagine all the gifts you’d receive remarrying the same girl though. He’s a genius! 
Do you really have two on the line😂
I’ve got two girls right now, but thanks :)
Hey Ben, I know a lot of Africans are interested in white folks, so if you’re having trouble dating you can always try Nigeria 
Lol good incentive for his wife to win 
Maybe every year no matter what he gets a divorce before the miss Nigeria is announced and then marries the winner every year
Well why would he divorce her if it was the same girl?
Are you assuming it’s not the same girl?
Goals
Guys jake is home
Thx B.B.
Look how freaking skinny I was... happy friendversary bb @Shad Karlson 
My friends apartment is pretty sick
We would just put our lips to the cup symbolically, then throw the cup in the tray.My presidents were big on repentance as well. It was rare for a missionary to go home. 
I didn’t take the water for a month because it was a mission wide rule by the President because of the crappy water... haha
My mission presidents were both big on repenting instead of going home. Obviously there were big sins where disciplinary action was required and they were sent home but most every other somewhat serious misconduct resulted in transfers and not partaking the sacrament for a period.
Yeah that’s what I’ve been told ^^
I imagine if a missionary had issues that needs to be resolved the process would be the same except for mission president directs you instead of Bishop 
Ya, because they were dads right?
I had multiple comps that didn’t 
Anyone have thoughts on this?
Ive been curious about that recently, not you guys specifically, just for missionaries in general. 
Created new poll 'Did you ever NOT take the sacrament while on your mission?': https://s.groupme.com/2eqkruR
The real 🐐🐐
This is America 
Maybe if hell froze over you could skate on it
The hell 
But if shad is wearing his hockey skates... 🤔
Has anyone else done the math? That means from her toes to her knees is a foot and 2 inches. Fishy.  4’6 is up to your chest. 
Shad, big girls need love too
Yeah... she would be 4’4” on her knees but her rolls give her a little extra height ;)
It could very well be a 50 year old 300 pounder ready to grape you in the mouth. 
Send her a picture of your stomach. Hair and all
Well shad you may as well take one for the team 
And the face
I saw her on mutual 😂, literally exact same profile
Gotta love tinder matches 
6 years ago today @John Hammond 
@Jon Michael Ossola Where you at?
Uh actually I meant Jon Michael 
Damn... straight up called out
Sorry that was all for Ben. 
😂😂😂
❤️
Right in the heart
Wow 
Not holding back at all 
Damn... ouch 
Or, get this, we could all take turns dating her because we’re too young to know what crazy looks like, and get jealous of each other, but in the end grow closer together because of her, and then she marries outside of the friend group.
Or we should practice taking a charge so she thinks we are tough
Woah...
You gotta post all the remakes
6 years ago today, and era was born. 
I’ll be there August 28th-September 1st. You guys?
It’s a fact! We’ll be there Labor Day week
Jake’s homecoming is on September 16th at 1
I miss you guys... 
Lol not anymore, I did during basic though
Do you carry 341’s with you, Ben?
The only hard part is that I had to do all that crap for 8 weeks. There wasn’t anything that was really hard. Now I’m living that tech school life
How was basic
Osborn! Ya went to seminary together
From Topeka
His name is Reid, I forget his last name
Also my golf class partner knows you
Logan you da real mvp!
I thank you all for some quality posts 👌🏻
I’m freaking back online boys! F you San Antonio!
Jake Maloney. What a power move
Screenshot off Shad’s phone
I’m with Ben in this one
I’ve obviously never encountered either so my opinion is mostly unimportant... but I would say it’s more like a vag for sure
I say depending on how close you are. From afar it would appear as a penis and up close I can the vaginal resemblance
Kori and I have been arguing all day. Does it look more like a dick or a vag? 
The internet
The hell did that come from 
Lol
Shad’s reading material
When are we all gonna play fortnite? They released 4 seater golf carts
That, my dear friends, is a DRIVE THRU Little Caesar’s Hot n Ready. We are all stuck in 2018 while Tullahoma, TN is living in 2469. 
Atta boi
Hey man, I’ve really pushed myself and gotten it to 6 minutes. We all have our own pace. 
I miss you man. These have been the craziest 3 weeks of our lives. We’ve been non-stop. We are in Chattanooga rn. 
Jackson 5 minutes doesn’t count as a work out
Jackson why the hell are you still not in Provo  
Boom roasted 
Our sex lives are all the cardio Zach and I need. 👀👀
Girls like it, it’s a scientific fact
Hey don’t hate the dad bod. Laura says she likes it...
But that would require you to visit the gym even semi-regularly @Jackson Esplin #dadbod #roasted
We all know I’m a danger boi 💦💦💦💦💦
You’er in the Air Force you danger guy ;)
Hmmm... which one am I...??
John is quirky boi 
But you did do summer sales so you just might get be a danger guy
*boi
Zach is quirky boy
We all know you are a nice and good boi
Which is everyone? Go!
^^😂
We are, but the week of Labor Day 
I’ll be there
Who’s planning on going home to see Jake?? I miss y’all niukkuhs 😪
Celestial Review, as drawn by Jon Michael Ossola 
How dare you accuse Shad of bandwagoning. We’ve been diehards since birth! 
I’ve always been a lakers fan!!
So Shad I’m guessing you’re a Lakers fan now? How does that make you feel?
Sam may call you sir but Shad calls me daddy 
He is like 12 still so ya know. Makes sense
Can I just say that having Sam Karlson address me as sir everyday is so satisfying...
I’m on board with this
Happy birthday jackson❤️😘
Now that Ariana Grande is engaged, Shad will have to alter his plans. 
Nathaniel was such a hoss
Hot damn. Mama, there goes those men.

Happy Birthday Logan!!! Love you budy!
I only just now got your Kansas anally post Jackson.
@Donkey
@Zach Preator 
@Shad Karlson 
My all-time favorite
Logan? Can you confirm?
Mr Fredrickson I don’t feel so good
Happy not a Father’s Day!!!
Cool Shad!!!!
Swag Zach!!!!
How Zach was beaten as a child
I’ll be there Friday night
Is anyone else in CO at all this week?
Next time, let’s get kicked out of a Dicks! #sendit
https://instagram.com/p/BfEoAQHnchn/
A 27 is indeed impressive. Even more impressive: a 66. 
Highest score of the day by me: 100
So we all know John has the highest score, but can anyone claim a score below 27?
A year ago I had all you can eat pizza for my birthday (and a good friends bachelor party) and thus a tradition is born
^gettin that pregame at smash burger? Nice
Smash and dash? Deal of a lifetime
I support you and all.. but why. Driving is quicker
Not to steal Zach’s thunder or anything but ya boi is running a 50 mile race tomorrow. Prayers would be greatly appreciated
ITS MY BIRTHDAY
Thanks bois☺️
Happy birthday Zach!!
Also, happy birthday Zach 
All I’m saying is, Jackson, pics or it didn’t happen
Oh yeah, and Ben too :) unless you Shad and John want to get together. Prove me wrong 
Definitely not that
Or is it just assumed I’m already having sex? 🙃
Sick, just leave me out of it
Speaking of sex. We are headed up to anniversary inn. We will have enough sex this weekend for Shad and John combined. 💀
I did no sex talk. You all made sex jokes about how I was going to pound Beck and Alec’s sister in front of them 😂
All you can eat pizza, Jackson talking nonstop sex and how he was gonna bang his soon to be wife, get out, great times.
Can’t believe one year ago we were celebrating Jackson’s bachelor party!! And celebrated nothing else
You can stay at my place Friday night 
So I have a wedding reception to go to Saturday afternoon And was either going to head back that night or Sunday 
Shut up
Did you text her
Shut up
I’m here all weekend you can stay with me if you want
I can probs smash tomorrow at some point
Niggaaaaas!!!!!
How many days are you here for?
I’m gone until Sunday 😪😪😪
I leave for CO on Saturday 
No nobody??
I bet you could sleep in the bed with Jackson and Kori 🙃
Yo Provo Bois I’m coming down tomorrow who’s ready to smash? And wants to give me a place to stay
John’s gay what..? John’s gay friend Zach? John’s gayer friend shad? John’s actual gay friend Shane? 
What a classic.  - https://youtu.be/B-Wd-Q3F8KM
Pics or didn’t happen
I think me saying she’s a girl you should answer that
She hot?
Sitting in my new Stats class and I think I’m sitting next to the Shad as a women

Ben, I saw Daphne at Panda Express today. It made me remember EFY and go to The Sheep page on FB. Go take a look, it’s hilarious 😂
I’m in denial still
Levels by Avicci. That song will live eternally 
I ask, Ben, because Avicii just died. You must be pretty shook. 
Ben you’re the man
Those memes are my new favorite Logan. I freaking love those. 
College nationals right now, seeded 3rd going into the semi finals tomorrow
Ben, how you holding up man?
Can’t sorry 😐 
no homo. Just still really impressed. I don’t think I’ve even played through all the levels
I wanna smash you❤️
Anyone wanna smash tonight?
Or maybe it’s the beginning and he’ll cure cancer next
I agree with Zach. That is the ultimate peak
Well there’s no where to go but down now. What an achievement 
Let’s freaking go!!!
Soundtrack of choice on long study days
A Zach level joke
John, greater men have aspired for less.

Shad I don’t get the classroom one
Hahaha that’s freaking hilarious 
He couldn’t see that well. 
Why did a half blind man fall into the well?
That second one 😂💀💀
That’s great Zach 10/10
Ben have you ever heard of a “dank” meme? That’s the point!
That is absolutely terrible

Bowled a 200 on the dot today. THATS WHY I DID IT
No arguments here
Won’t deny it
Back when Zach and Jackson were skinny...
Does anyone else hit translate on Ben and Shads Korean and Japanese comments and just think it sounds like the dirtiest thing ever. Yellow fever. 
Haha if only
You derf?
Thanks guys! It was a success 
Go get that poon!
Go get her John! Take no prisoners!!!

Currently walking to her door right now
Thanks! 😬
Let’s all wish John some luck on his date tonight! Atta boi. 
Of course Jackson. Cena memes are life
Oh. True. Thank you for understanding my joke. :)
Shad there’s a ginger guy in my ward that’s way nicer and replaced you with him
You don’t see the people in the stands?
Zach why did you post a gif with no one in it?
How could you
Lol
Haven’t you heard? We’ve been replaced
Ya
The New York New York specifically 
Without us
Vegas
Where
Well boys I dropped 11 bucks gambling last night and lost it all
Yes^
Kirby f***s
Shoulda been Kirby
They’re having Smash competitions in line for the BYU game. I destroyed the competition in my first match with who else? Sonic b****
If only I hadn’t had such bad luck with Blackjack in Vegas... :/
Yesss shad
And Zach 
And I miss you bae 
I’ve still never been
Lol oh John
What’s her name?
Why would you want to do that to yourself?
John I need to drive up to Rexburg soon
Let’s just all make this pic our Cover Photo. Everyone, hop on board!
You’re hair is so perfect. 
Not for long though. I’ve seen that drive😉
Shut up
Aren’t you like 10 lbs heavier though now?
You will now see this picture everywhere 
Im gonna have to take a lil more than a minute
Daaaaayyyuuumm

Please
Yes. That’s the dream
My wife is asking if she should tag you guys in all the wedding photos. Like ALL of them 
Yes
Remember the one that I photoshopped JM’s face on all of ours. 
Notice anything in this pic (hint: it’s my nipple)

I just got this message from my engineering class. Stereotypes are true for a reason
I’ve been dreaming about this day for years now 😍😍
Everyone go follow BYU hockey. Today is a truly glorious day!!
I don’t remember ever telling them that I like Wendys hahaha
I’d also like to nail shad
They nailed Shad
I’m officially a husband
Bowling*
If I could scrape off any of that talent I would you bowing maniac. 😘 good job👍👍❤️
Yes great job Jackson I am very proud of you!!!
Ha gay!
Congratulations Jackson 😊❤️ so happy for you
Demi?
John is a bowling demi god
So at least 9 to 2? 
I have 6 scores over 200
And ITS ABISH
I have a 202 and a 203 John has several over 200 and if shad has any over 200 than we hookers outnumber your 2 scores 6 or greater to 2. Just sayin😘 
I now have a 213 and a 224 bish
What do you mean 2 top scores?
Hunter could tell ya that
A straight bowler has 2 top scores better than Zach and Shad’s top scorers. Plus, girls never like a hook 😘
#straightbowlgays
But #hookers4lyfe
240
Pathetic I know
Mines only 203
Wait what’s y’all high score? I thought it was 230 something
But I’m still winning
Gosh. Dang. It. John, let’s bowl again.
I’ve been in a real rut since I’ve been home from the mish. Feels good to be back 
Kind of choked at the end, but Daddy is f***ing home
So, uh, Vegas?
This was only like the 8th hit after searching Katy perry says happy birthday. I hope you like it @Shad Karlson 
I feel no way more suitable to wish our boy a happy birthday: 
As I sent that I thought that I should have reconsidered...
Past?
Don’t be ashamed. We share a dark past
I didn’t want to say it was a creeper but that’s the first thing I thought 
Nope. Think Minecraft. 
The avatar state?
Notice carefully what this is fellas 
What a memory 
It’s the solo trailer but the falcon is so clean because it’s a tide ad

Last one for tonight.

Anyone studying mechanical engineering?
And I think the more awkward moment was when Laura fist bumped me! 😂😂😂
And yes, two different girls 😆
But thanks again Zach!! I’ve got a date on Friday and Saturday too if you or Jon want to join in..
Never doing that again 😂
That awkward moment when you’re trying to figure out why Jon michaels date has some interesting bruises on her neck.....birth marks? Maybe. 
Literally best show ever. And greatest way to end a date!!!
Date night ends with watching Avatar

No
Can either of you that don’t borrow one? I have an extra Grey suit too
Yah B
No
Nope:/
I do
Out of curiosity do you all have grey suits? It’s supposed to be like, super cold. Ben included.😘

We need to change the group name
Perfect 👌🏾

Zach
We are roaming around aimlessly 
Do you want a ride back from campus
I’ll be ready to go 10:25.
Sorry it’s taking so long
And someone please pick up some pizza from little ceasers 
Let’s get this weekend started right now!
Everyone get your butts over here. 
883 e 620 n Provo Utah
Doba was closed common. Trust us will ya Jackson?
I know isn’t it great 
You blatantly chose Chipotle and aren’t bringing me Doba?
When you stop for a quality burrito 
No Shad and I are leaving with you guys in Shad’s car. It’ll be the 6 of us between 2 cars
My car is Laura John and I. I guess logan is coming with us and Jackson could come too but it would get tight
Us?
I guess I never really thought about it
Yeah, who is Laura going with?
Ari is staying with Audrey and Kori and are leaving Provo at 5
Woah what
And Laura I think, right? 
Is it us 5 then??!
I can be at my house ready to go by 10:30 at the earliest I think
I’m good leaving at whatever time. I’ve just got to take my test. It’s up to the Shad man
Not sure yet. And Jackson I thought we were leaving at like 10?
Also, who is in our car?
I am all about getting it on the road. I’m not trying to meander down there, ya know? 
This is taking forever. We are making terrible time.
Are we feeling lunch here right before we leave? All I have is a test tomorrow morning, so I’d be down for some grub then we hit the road
Got it
Buy them out and run the franchise
Drive safe today boyz. If you drive past a QDoba... you know what to do. 😘
Just kidding sounds good
I’ll bring suits for all of you
I would be fine with normal clothes.. the only suit I’ll have is my wedding suit, and I don’t really want that smelling like casino.. 
My silver suit? It's the nicest thing i have
So Thursday night are we going to swag it up? Like dress code? I’m willing to black suit black tie suspenders just give me the word.
FB translate exposes Benjamin Pagel
Grey pants. Brown shoes if you got em, if not black works fine. Katie is providing the ties
Oh wait that’s after
Nothing but a smile 😉
Hey what are we wearing to the wedding?
Me basically
https://instagram.com/p/BPflExugubm/
Happy Monday everyone
Love you man^^^^ 😭😭😭
It’s really a miracle we all came through strong. I don’t think I would have made it without you guys❤️
In all honesty Kensie and Kaylee both look like they're on a really good path. Happy for them
This is pretty cool
Does anyone have an extra pair of pants I can change into?
Ari has confirmed riding with us
What’s class?
I'm working on it... let me check my schedule when I get out of class.
I haven’t heard anything about JM
Audrey and Ari are coming yes
So is Audrey planning on coming? It would be nice to know. Also apparently there are towels for 8 so if she would like her own she will have to bring one
If Jon Michael and Audrey come it’s 9 of us but I’m not sure about Jon Michael 
9 people makes it $62 and 8 is $70
If Audrey and Ari come how much would the B and B be per person
Grand papa Linford 
Who
So on Friday Laura and I did proxy sealings at the ft. Collins temple and guess who our sealer was.
# positivity
Lol i did though
I would also call him on his lie that Shad had a great experience 
Its good for married guys looking for cash... As long as you're better at it than i was
I have some serious questions about that message. What can be exciting in a “D2D” industry?
I got one last year. But I’m open to them buying me lunch again 
I got the same thing. Does this mean Shad’s my friend now?
He just wanted some names
Haha i know you're not gonna do it
 Freaking Shad 😂
Dangit shad 
Went to st George with some of the boys then caught a preseason golden knights game in Vegas
What were you down there for?
Ya as we were leaving the strip we saw like 10 cop cars passing us going towards it
Yeah I didn’t even realize. Was it crazy there?
Dude I forgot you were there holy crap
Im safe guys
That Vegas shooting: scary stuff man 
Dibs on queen size bed with Shad. 😘
Yikes. Haha. Well whatever we will figure it out. Audrey can sleep with Kori if all else fails and I’ll sleep on the floor #goodguyJackson
https://media2.giphy.com/media/PEraMk92sEjWE/giphy.gif
There are two queen beds in their own rooms then a room with two twin beds and then two couches
That’d be a freaking blast. Also, I’m going to the Doba in Vegas on Saturday for lunch. Don’t know about y’all 
Caravan!!
So we should all plan on leaving at 11?
No. We’re out of couches
Ok that’s fine there’ll be a couch I’m sure 
Audrey can come yeah, but at that point we might be out of beds
Yeah Logan you’re good to squeeze in😘
And Ari I think. Sorry this is all news to me haha
So interesting news: I just heard that Audrey was planning on coming and staying in the house... How does that change things? 
May I also squeeze you?
So I can squeeze with you then Zach?
Sweet! 
So, 2 is ideal for me, but 11 works fine too
Haha 11 is fine with me. Y’all are invited to come eat dinner with my family and Katie’s family Thursday night. FYI
That’s kind of early to get up
Woah. Maybe 11 if you’re nice. 
I’ll check my schedule 
Logan if you need to be there early go with Zach and John I think they said they’re going at 9 or so
Yeah
Y’all got a place to stay?
Dope. 
Laura, John, ari and I will be in Provo Wednesday evening 
Haha whoops Zach. Forgot you’re in CO
That way we could get there in time for dinner that my mom has planned for everyone. 
11 is totally cool with me
That seems like a bit of a detour 
Shad I was hoping to leave around 11 if possible
From Idaho right zach?
My first class ends at 10 45. @Jackson what do you think about going at 11?
I’m thinking 10 or 11
I'm plannimg on leaving provo at 2 with whoever wants to come with me
I’m thinking we go by car
So what are the plans for everyone driving down to Vegas? 
Please watch 😂 https://instagram.com/p/BZPAPT4Av-w/

Yo I haven't checked if you guys have or not, but on Facebook laura and I have a link to put your addresses in so we have them. So if you haven't, please do that😊
Your memes have gotten danker 
Logan? Down?
We could go see get out!
That's still a lot though. 
The best way would be to try to find scalpers right when the puck drops. I bet we could find some for 40ish
I want nothing more in life then a girl leaving me notes calling me a slut
What can I say. We are nasty
How did this go in noticed 
Wait a minute 
The cheapest I can find is like 100 per tic
Nvm they're pretty expensive

Let's freaking do this! 
I'm bored 
Like League of legends...
Like... with NERF??
Anybody wanna LOL right now?
We are down for anything really. That's probs not what you want to hear haha. If we were to do a show we probably wouldn't do Cirque or Blue man 
Hey laura and I were talking about things to do for either Saturday night or bachelor party in the vegas. Here's her suggestions 
https://instagram.com/p/BYEsqmPAbbd/
Which way to primary? Freaking baby face af
Which way to the neo-nazi rallies?
Keep it for Jackson and I 
It's beautiful
Don't
💦💦💦
Say goodbye 
😂😂😂
Shad this is a disgrace. 
Wish I spoke Portuguese...or even Spanish...or any other language for that matter
You guys should hike the Y. It's totally LIT. 😉
I see you Zach
C'mon zach you're an engaged man
Conversation between zach and my sister lol
I'm here bois and I'm down for what ever. I'm planning on either leaving with zach and laura so we will all be in Provo that night. Basically what ever zach and laura are doing I'm  following. But deffs strippers and a temple trip  
So i can't unfortunately
Hockey biatch
We are going to stay that Sat night if y'all are
John once again
It's ok logan. Rather you not be there really. Don't think that's allowed there
John where you at boi?
Freaking guys I'm getting so pumped. Logan is the man good work on finding a Vegas girl! 
Sorry zach. 
Go know your wife!
Logan is going to be keeping a quite different commandment at that time. 
Sorry bud but I'm gonna pass on the temple that day. 😉😏😏😏
Twice now. Only one room for the whole endowment session, but the whole temple is really pretty!
Logan have you been to the temple there much,
Beyond down 
Stop typing while I'm typing Jackson 
Like Saturday after logans wedding (sorry logan)
The day after Logan's wedding?
Yeah man that would be awesome! Up in ID?
In*
I'm the vegas temple 
So laura is thinking about getting endowed like next month, would you guys be down for a Saturday morning sesh+lunch?
That's what I was thinking ^^
I'm down to like go out to eat somewhere cool and then set aside like $15 and play black jack or something. We could all dress up with swagger too. Tuxedo night! 
So a lot of hotels have "dancers" at night in the casinos. It's like pg13 stripping... 
Right? ^^^
I know we probs want to stay temple worthy but a vegas bachelor party with no strippers?? Cmon....
Is there any other plan besides hit the strip with 💵💸💰
👌🏻 
We need to plan that out
Whats the itinerary Thursday night?
I'm willing to miss class as well if need be
Probably to get all checked in and stuff. We can leave at 10?
Zach, any chance you and L-Dawg will leave earlier on Thursday? Like 11 am?
It's a bout a 5 hour drive FYI. Plus one hour time change. That will get you here at 8 pm if you left at 2
And Jackson after 1 50 on Thursday would be perfect for me
Also my plan is still to stay just thursday and Friday night but I'm willing to pay the full price as well
On it boss.
I know I'll make sure to see if Ari wants to come if you want to talk to JM
Do you want to leave around 11 or 12 o'clock on Thursday?
GUYS. Do you think Jon Michael will come and possibly stay with us?!
I have a class until 1:50, but if we need to be in Vegas earlier you know I'll miss for my brodies 
We can caravan there
Yeah that's what I was thinking. We have a freaking bachelor to celebrate boi 
Oh you know i am
Morning or afternoon
Nice. Down for a roadtrip?
I'll probs drive there thursday
Jackson I'll have a car after all
That's fine. Whether we leave that Sat night or Sun morning we will pay our price. That's fair
Well the price wouldn't change. If we all decide to leave Saturday night I can see if laura can take off a day. The thing is that we booked the entire place for the 4 days. So if people leave early and don't pay laura for the day they weren't there it will cost the rest of us more
Kori and I were thinking about leaving Saturday night, but only if it's cheaper. If we pay the same price, we will stay until Sunday morning. We have some family we were thinking about visiting in Cedar City that we thought would be out of town that weekend. 
Sooooo, air B and B. Who was leaving early? 
Down. 
👍🏼 
So I'll just hit up one of y'all for a ride. 
Okay. My plan is to be here Thursday, I was gonna fly, but then I was like, I got some broskis coming down. 
Shad and I were going to figure something out to get down there
Can I get a ride?
Thursday?
Laura and I are spending Wednesday night in Provo and then we'll drive.
How are you guys coming down here to Vegas for the wedding?
Haha ya i know but i was dead tired last night and had a 6 am flight this morning
Man. I would have been at your house in approximately half of a shake of a branch of a tree in the middle of a hurricane. Which is fast
No i flew back. I was in estes for like 2 days
You think i got time for dat?
Are you still here?!?
It was in one of my moms scrapbooks
I was in co for the weekend for a family reunion
If you're into scrapping you should make one of the group 
Ya
Shad is that a scrap book 
I miss those days. 
Logan looks photoshopped in too😂
Haha with my all black pic you can barely see me niukkuh

So, when Ari comes home we are flying to CO, but our flight comes back in to Provo at 11:45 pm that Sunday night (Sept. 17th), would one of my Provo broskis be able to pick us up at the airport...? 😊 I'll pay with QDoba
Saturday night doing it right

Hey sorry I'm late on this but I'm gonna have to leave the day after the wedding so i won't be able to stay there saturday night
Dayz*
Jk there's couches for days
But seriously like a blow up mattress and badabing
He can sleep on the floor if need be. 
Do you think Jon Michael will come?
Zach you're the man. Thanks bubz 
And a tennis court!!
Just kidding, we are booked for 7 at a place with a hot tub and pool
Kool. So far it looks like 5 of us? 
Ok. I'll see if Kori has a guess on Ari, if not, I'll let you know Monday 
Yeah 
Thurs to Sunday?
So it all depends on Ari then?
Kori won't get in until Thurs night most likely, maybe Fri morning. I was planning on asking shad for a ride whenever he goes up if that's ok Shadders
Sure. We'll book as soon as we know. But like a few of them are already taken, so we need to hurry
Other than that, Kori and I are 100% in. 
I emailed Ari, she won't get back to me until Monday. Is that too late?

Haha I just screenshoted this! 
😂😂😂
What a fag
I don't think he has a phone yet
Whatre bens digits
Sounds good. I'll talk to Kori 
She compiled it for Thursday to Sunday
Next couple of days probably
Is it 90-140/night? Or 90-140 total for the 3 nights?
I don't know. How soon do I need to know?
Soo. Air b&b. Laura said there's a few by Katie's place ranging from 90 a person to 140 a person from Thursday to Sunday. Some have a pool. Any opinions? Is ari for sure gonna stay with us?
Shad is my favorite in this. 
Never forget #gaze
Reunited at a reunion
Aww yeah
Just talked to the Ben 😍😍 the "jeez man" lives on
Best audio ever 😂😂https://www.facebook.com/RelationshipGoalsUS/videos/703567619845029/
Group name.
Besties with testies 
I loled
Sliding into second base like
You can show up with that if you want
That tie is nothing but winter 
Booooooo ;)
We actually considered bow ties... decided it wasn't a winter thing
If this isn't Zach's tie for his December 23rd wedding, im not going
But in a truer sense no not so much
In a sense yes
Making money?
Sales life
Trevor was way older than John that's for sure
Why because we beat you guys
The moldy PAGELS
^^^^^
 No
THE MOLDY BAGELS
Fab 5 + Ben. 
What about keeping the FAV FIVE name in acronym form. For example:Fruity Artistic Boys Find Intense Velocity Equations
Hahaha, thanks nerf's lol at 505
Flaccid rain!
The bigot 6
Hitlarious
The jews?
Hard
What's work?
This is so distracting at work
Sharks with freakin gayzer beams
Gay zers 
Mish*
Or we spell it 6pax
Maybe he lost it on the mush
I think Ben will go for 6packs
I agree. 
😂😂😂
Shad! Thanks for joining us
I vote we change the name
If it's not floral it's not me
Someone doesn't want his free tie
Please commment more so we can get that freaking gif off the screen
To keep 5 we could add Ben and vote Zach off 
Fab*
Fav 5 and appendages 
But you know how rm's can be weird right after they get back, let's give him a week or two to adjust
What if we are the Fab 5 but there's 6. Like the 7 pieces of 8
How about we ask ben on whether fab 5 stays or not
Ben gets home tomorrow!!!!
Oh wow.... the flash backs
https://media4.giphy.com/media/saKCyIk3CfeWQ/giphy.gif
I say we add Ben. Then JM and Jake when they come home
You know me too well 
I was just about to post this about John... 😂 but he beat me to it
Haha nah, she knows. 
As much you try and hide she already knows or will know
😏
I don't want Katie to know how weird we are
^^^
But I don't want 10billion group chats
I agree with Logan
As am I
My thought process is that we can have a big blob of a chat that we aren't sentimentally attached too, that we can add/remove anyone and leave fab 5 untarnished
Here's the thing: I'm down to have this group include Ben Jon micheal and Jake. 
Oh. Yeah. 😂
I was thinking more like wives/girlfriends😂
The fab 5 is a fantastic name...
Jk, that was me growing up
Ok wow.
I DONT LIKE KENSIE!!
Kensie. Obama. Bin Laden. All close personal friends
Let's get Sabrina up in this
Ari Kori 
Scarlett
Audrey
Do we have one with girls associated? 
Jake, Jon Michael, Trevor possibly
For now
The only other person would be Ben
And the fab five name
What if we have a separate fab five and a chauvs page? So we maintain this inner ring 
The star gazers ➡️the chauves ➡️fab 5➡️ ???
All great options but the fab 5 will have my heart forever 
Half dozen homos(apiens)
Half dozen homos
Dirty mike and the boyz
But also the niggaz and six pack
I love the sexist six
The six packs
How about the niggaz?
In the end I just really like fab 5
Created new poll 'New group name options.': https://s.groupme.com/UcmJq2Z
Clever😉 I don't know, good question
Haha, see what I did there ^
Can he see old posts, or just the posts that come in after he's Ben added?
He was a gazer. In fact he instigated the 1..2..3... gays! At trek
I agree, but I think it would be good. Not only is this chat for hilarious memes and flashbacks, but also for main plans and gazer news. 
Buttt, that's gonna be rough for him... rightThoughts?
So we gotta get Ben in this group chat, right?
Anybody remember this gem??
Friday
I'm pretty sure Ben gets home tomorrow or Thursday
Yeah he was awesome 😂 he also made rings and wrote poems on scrolls. He keeps them in his backpack. Pretty sick rings 
And knives?
Overheard a student today: "yeah our high school football sucks. It's the band everyone cares about. The football team only exists to bring in funding for the band. In fact, the band actually played the the team in football and won. Yeah. The band is really what it's all about. And knives." I thought I escaped all of this :/
Well said 
Bro. 4 for 4. 50 cent frostys. Get your head out of your a**.  Wendys
Wendy's 
Help. McDonald's or Wendy's 
1300 but I didn't get the wedding band. 
Total spent? $45 to get it cleaned
Well I spent 2000 on a ring/bands buuuuut. Yeah I'm getting that back
I always ask recently engaged dudes haha, is that wrong of me
No.
Would it be weird to talk about how much we spent on rings?
It's got 60 days 😂 I'll do it this week
Did you return that ring? I'm sure that was nice

Harambe was wise beyond his years
Tears... were shed
She gave it to me. I can get a full refund on the other one. 
Awks 
Didn't you already buy a ring?
Did you buy the ring from her, or did she give it to you?
Just got Laura's grandmothers ring, the blessing from the parents and a date for the 23rd of December at the ft Collins temple. All In one day
And pretty loud. 
Yesterday they were selling 50 dollar BNB gift cards for 40 dollars. I'll go check if that's still a thing. Also, Ari might come out too, but I don't know. But an B and B sounds awesome to me
It'll probably be long and drawn out too
Super hard. 
You're right
Actually it will be hard
You'll probably spend the night with your wife. The decision won't be too hard when it comes down to it😂
❤️
https://media0.giphy.com/media/3ohzdTQbM6efMXZaOQ/giphy.gif
You know you have true homies for life when you are torn between spending your wedding night with your wife, or your broskis. Y'all are the real mvps
That means it's about 45 min from Katie's house and the reception. 
It's 7 minutes from the temple? I'll check with laura tonight
I'd be down for that. Check the address
Sweet let's do it!
Make sure it's not too far from Katie's house, for your convenience... her address is 7417 kings wharf lane, Las Vegas 89123
For logans wedding in case you couldn't infer
So laura and I were looking into air B and B and there was a 6 person one for $134 a night 3 rooms 2 queens and two singles. And a couch in case Jackson and kori get in a tussle 
Tried on laura, can confirm, works.
Best pickup line: "are you from Tennessee? Because you are about a 6"
https://media0.giphy.com/media/1zSiX3p2XEZpe/giphy.gif
Make that 100%I'm there
Then I guess I can be there
3 ties in one year
Yes
Are there more free ties involved?
You better be there
We are still trying to work out plans for everything. I'll give it a 90% chance!
😍
Yessir
If so I can probs hitch a ride with you for the wedding. 
Most likely yeah
Jackson are you driving to CO after finals?
Anybody else coming?
23rd is awesome for us
Everybody let me know if the 23rd works. I need to let laura know if we need to go earlier
Yeah
Are you doing CO?
Blessed
If you guys are both going on cruises we could just all go #honeymoonofthelifetime

Wait, while I watched porn or Vikings?
I know I was in the room while you watched it.....
Viking porn. That describes 20% of it perfectly
To those of us who don't watch boring as Zombies or Viking porn here's how I feel 
To all the Barbie movie fans AKA me
For my fellow Vikings fan. @Logan Camilletti 
For my TWD fans aka Zach
Succ wasn't right?
Oh yeah so up date. No.
John you still dating emma?
This is what Ben sent me this week haha
Remember that girl shad took on a date to the Rockies game? 
When jacksons meme placement is juuuuust right
Brethren... I don't want this to worry you for marriage or anything... but since my wife is an awesome cook and feeds me awesome food and we don't got out very much because it costs money... my stomach struggles to handle McDonald's. We had it for the 2nd time today... and both times I've struggled to keep it down... 
I'll be there
But because its you I'll make it regardless ❤❤❤
I might have a hockey game
Do it for the free ties
Yes
Y’all. Katie decided on the ties 😬 all four of you can make it, right?
10/10 🔥
Thought this was funny idk why
Debby downer
Yeah but it's only for like 2 weeks or so until he's back at AFA
Dude I'm pretty sure he gets back in like three weeks. Something crazy soon like that
Or somewhere around there 
22 of July 
When does ben get home?
Someone tell Shad to come home. Took a feels trip
I feel you Shadder. :/ 
Aaaaaand kill yourself
Cool shad!! I wanted to see the same picture twice 😀
https://goo.gl/images/NJVdvf
Currently listening to slacker and Steve and missing the good days
I feel like we're in one of those disaster movies where one by one people sacrifice themselves to save the rest and then there's only one person left. Cough *shad* cough.
😂😂😂
Just don't let this become your marriage... it's already happening to me
"That's why I did it!!"
No, still not forgiven
John, I appreciate you
Jackson that is what I am talking about!
Logan all that time you spent ditching Zach and I to make out with her is now forgiven 
I want shad to strip. I've wanted him to strip all along
Strippers for days
Holy smokes I didn't even think about that Johnny boy. LETS GOOOOO. 
Alright, start planning now
Katie is working on the details of what color ties. But yeah you'll get one. You'll all get one!!!!
Bachelor party in Vegas baby!!!!!
You know we will be brother. If I get a tie out of it. 😳
October 13 at 1:30 pm Las Vegas. Y'all better be there.

Low key thought this was for shad at first glance before nostalgia kicked in
I remember sitting in my basement laughing super hard because I found mustache tape and I wrote swerve😂
I don't know if I ever knew about this
I forgot about that
Never forget my going away card. 
This meme reminds me of the good ol days 
Still crazy that she has a kid...
Man I still can't pronounce her name
Cool Shad
But her husband and madelines bf are good friends
I passed by Rurly at BYUH today but we didn't make eye contact so i didn't talk to her haha

This needs to be Shad's tinder pic 
Stop
^in bed
We all know that none is are going harder then Jackson and Kori
Not if laura and I go harder
Jk! Katie and I will freaking be there so hard!
Probably not. She still is trying to talk to her boss about it. 
Katie can't come?😭
Good thing Katie can't come anyway! Bummer. 
Dang that's rough. I'll let her down easy
Hey handsomes. So after talking to Kori and after lots of planning and number gathering etc., we figured out that we wouldn't be able to have any girlfriends at the luncheon or at the temple. It would open a can of worms that would bother a few people. But they are totally invited to the reception we want them to be there. I'm sorry 😭
Hell yeah
Guys.... the Rockies have the best record in the league. Today must be the day Shad finds his wife to be. 
Sam's reaction when i said y'all were on the verge of marriage
#prayforshad
With what. Matches? Oh please 
5!! Shad is going to beat both Logan and Zach 
4 matches. I need to lie down...
John is my inspiration
Three matches for Shad. Holy smokes 
I think so.  HOT TUB!!!
Bring hot tub material
I'm kidding 😂
Don't remember
I ditched?
Are you staying with us??? Are you going to ditch us like Zach did 😭
I is. With Katie. 😍

Swag you'll see my momma too. She's in town until Saturday
I would expect nothing less. Laura had Thursday Friday and Monday off, so we'll come in Thursday evening. And leave Monday morning 
What day do you come in? And are you and Laura in the same bed? I would be disappointed if otherwise 
Hey so I might have mentioned it before, but my uncle in Provo will probably let us stay at his place so logan John laura and I will have a place. Did you have any other plans for us Jackson?
My college life so far 
This day will go down in infamy 
Caption this
As you can see my name right there
John and I talked about that today
This is tough on all single men everywhere, but Shad, our prayers go out to you. 
So I'm the last one find out this is lame
Prrregante!
I was talking to her 2 weeks ago and she told me. I promised I wouldn't tell. 
Yeah my mom told me last week. Prett crazy
PREGANANANT?!
This is not common knowledge don't tell anyone
I just got this from Danielle Fletcher talking to Sanrina Swicegood 
Wait logan. What's the other 30%?
Because he ripped them right?
I want you guys to see it in person first 😭 although when shad saw it he had to change his pants 
70%?
70% sure I'm going
Pics or it didn't happen. 
The ties are lit
John and I are. Not sure about logan 
Guys. Your ties have arrived. You all still planning on coming here first week of April?

Ok Jackson, maybe you've mentioned this before, but. Are you guys living in Utah or Colorado this summer?
I'd rather come down another weekend. 
Saturday night
When is it?
Grey and Bennett. 
What roommates? How many?
I'm coming down with my roommates for a concert in salt lake. 
Wait do you have a car??
Im probably still coming down
Haha no that's fine
Yeah... I get it... 😭😭😭
I think it's gonna snow pretty hard this weekend. That might complicate things a little. 
Guyz how are we feeling about this weekend 
Team Jeaprody: "Who are this year's contenders for the Super Bowl?" Other team: "no idea"None of them knew... 😂😂
I think I screenshotted right at 3 as well😂

All those valet parking dollars bae
#missin the niggs
Still only sitting at gray but i can drop a few dolla bills no big deal
Swag
Black. Ya I got black. 
So John and Logan do not have blue or black pants?
Jackson, you look fabulous. Don't you think less of yourself
True (Insert shad lip smack here) true
John I can hear the water. Don't text in the bathroom
She knows that if you guys suit up, half of you will look better than me
......but nothing suits me like a suit
I'm not coming
We aren't doing coats for groomsmen, just pants and a white shirt and tie.  We can't suit up :/
John can wear my blue suit coat, and I'll wear the pants
I have dark grey suit pants
That's fine.  As long as they are blue or black.  I'll check if gray works
I'll just I have a gray suite and that's it
The ones I'm referring to are my suit pants
Suit pant?
I don't have slacks that aren't gray. And I'll just settle for groomsman I know my place...
Haha no you don't need to buy slacks.  Suit pant?
Yes I will be THE best man. No I don't have slacks. But for you baby...
And yes I would love to be your best man ❤️❤️
Ha. Ha. Haha
Yes I do have navy blue slacks
Sorry, we're all kind of slacking on communication this morning
All I need to know is who of you have navy blue slacks? And if not, do you have black slacks?
Hey so this goes unsaid really, but will you guys all be my groomsmen?😘
Shows how much I care
It straight up autocorrected itself. But I'll kill myself for the team
